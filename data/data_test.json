I burst out laughing because it was actually my youngest son\u2019s (now 17!) book from when he was a kid. He had scrawled Joseph on the front inside cover (nearly illegible as he was 4! and only a mom would recognize it!) and Sophia was irritated thinking her little sister was disrespecting her books.  Turns out my daughter had raised my storage container looking for her Nancy Drew books, but came across Joseph\u2019s box!  I immediately bought Sophia her own!", "images": [], "asin": "1442450703", "parent_asin": "1442450703", "user_id": "AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ", "timestamp": 1523093714024, "helpful_vote": 94, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Five Stars", "text": "Can't wait to try these patterns!", "images": [], "asin": "1564770672", "parent_asin": "1564770672", "user_id": "AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ", "timestamp": 1441260365000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Five Stars", "text": "Her books are great and I love making the animals!", "images": [], "asin": "1446304000", "parent_asin": "1446304000", "user_id": "AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ", "timestamp": 1441260345000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Aweeeeesome.", "text": "If you're looking for a comprehensive resource for NCLEX prep, look no further...this book is fantastic. Extensive topic coverage complete with rationales for every response. Prefer going online to take quizzes? No problem this book's got that, too. (Although the content online is a tad bit confusing to navigate, once you figure out how to get to the quizzes section, you won't forget.) I have several books for review and this one is my personal favorite. Some of my professors loan this text out to students, but I prefer 24/7 availability in my own home! :-) Happy studying, future nurses!<br /><br />UPDATE: I saw sooo many reviewers having trouble getting to the online content to take system-specific quizzes that I decided to post instructions here on how to get to the right place.<br /><br />1) Go to the Pearson Pegasus log-in page once you've set up online access, and log in.<br />2) Click on the book title on the left side of the website.<br />3) On the next page, on the left side near the top, you will see a menu bar that has the following options: \"Today's View, Course Content, Grades, Communicate\". Look just BELOW this menu bar and you will see the following options: \"View All Content, Course Calendar, Learning Objectives.\"<br />4) Click on Learning Objectives.<br />5) On the left side, you will see the following options: \"Client Need, Topics Areas, Integrated Process.\"<br />6) To take quizzes related to your system or topic of choice, click the plus sign for \"Topics Areas\".<br />7) Click on your system of choice.<br />8) On the right side, there are several options for that topic of study. Scroll down to the bottom-ish. You will see a heading called \"Self Study\" for that topic of study. Click on it.<br />9) A separate pop-up window will appear so that you may begin your quiz.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to comment below.

First off, the specs are impressive for such a low-priced laptop. 4 GB's of RAM, 500 GB's of storage, 1.8Ghz processor, and a middle of the line nVidia graphics card is a steal of a deal at the current price Amazon is selling this laptop for. The first thing you'll notice that might make your eyes pop is the shipping weight of 7.8 lbs! Fear not though, I put this laptop on my trusty scale and the results came back as 4.2 lbs (.4 lbs lighter than advertised). I also have a 13.3 Macbook Pro with Retina Display, which weighed in at 3.4 lbs. So if you're looking for a laptop that you'd like to do a lot of traveling with and you can afford paying almost three times as much, you might be better off looking at a Macbook or a Macbook Air. If you can't afford jumping up to the price of an Apple, this laptop will still be very convenient to tote around as it is very slim and sleek.<br /><br />Setting up this laptop was extremely easy, as I was able to immediately connect it to my home WI-FI system. This was my first experience with Windows 8, and I must admit it was a bit jolting, but I was able to get used to it after a while. The next paragraph I'm about to type is by far the most important and useful one to read, so if you're going to ready any paragraph, please read the one below.<br /><br />This computer came with a trial-version of McAfee anti-virus software. That means that you get the software for a trial period, but then you have to pay for it in order to keep getting virus definition updates. Let me save you a lot of time and money, DELETE THIS FROM YOUR COMPUTER AS SOON AS YOU SET IT UP. This sounds extremely backwards, but let me explain. Microsoft has been providing free anti-virus software for Windows users for years via download. The software is called Microsoft Security Essentials, and is superior to all third party virus programs in the way that its free and also that it comes straight from Microsoft, who is always the first company to know when an issue has come up because the issue involves their own software. Companies like McAfee and Norton get their information from Microsoft, so there is always a lag. For Windows 7 and prior, you would need to download Microsoft Security Essentials in order to get the anti-virus protection, but with Windows 8, it is already installed via a beefed up version of Windows Defender that includes Microsoft Security Essentials. The trick is, and this is important, you have to remove any third party anti-virus program before being able to turn on Windows Defender. Microsoft had to do this in order to avoid getting sued by the big anti-virus companies, but make no mistake about it, YOU DO NOT NEED TO PAY FOR ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION EVER AGAIN. Uninstall whatever was installed to begin with, re-start your computer, and turn on Windows Defender and you will be set. Anti-virus rant over!<br /><br />I've been using this laptop for the past several weeks and could not be happier with it. The screen resolution is impressive, and the built-in webcam works great for Skyping.

I will hopefully update it in a few months after continued, heavy use. Ihave had it for 5 days, and this is my impression.<br /><br />Initially, out of the packaging, it is a sleek, minimal looking machine with very nice specs. In a world with countless laptops and configs, this is a nice middle of the road laptop for a fair price at $650.<br /><br />The laptop does boot/hibernate/wake/sleep very fast, which is nice. The track pad is very nice for a pc, not the same as the macbook, but close, and I find it to be intuitive, and easy to use. The battery is impressive for a pc, and I am able to get a solid 6 hours out if, which I appreciate, although you have to alter a few settings.<br />The screen is nice, and does have limited viewing angles, but I find that to be minor as I usually sit directly in front of it.<br /><br />Windows 8 is nice on this machine, just learning it, but am doing so fast.<br /><br />I recommend and 8GB ram upgrade to use it to max potential. It only has one slot up to 8GB, so be warned. I got a 1 x 8 GB crucial stick and it is working great.<br /><br />The performance is great for day-to-day basics, and light gaming, and all MS Office applications.I have also installed Photoshop and will update to let everyone know how that works.<br /><br />I love this laptop for the price (i paid $649), and would recommend it for the money v. performance factor.<br /><br />It is very sturdy, but still light enough for carrying/traveling. I am impressed with Dell and the product they put out on this machine.<br /><br />***UPDATE 11/20/2015***<br /><br />I have been using this laptop for over a year now, and they say distance makes the heart grow fonder and proxitimity breeds contempt, this is true for this laptop. Windows 10 is a big NO, maybe a fresh install will help. It has been sluggish for the past 14 months, it just doesn't perform. Every action is delayed, the drivers have been a continuous battle, and still my brightness is stuck ALL the way up. The machine has &#34;impressive specs&#34; but just has under performed in all sectors. it just doesn't do anything well and weighs way too much. I had said it wasn't an issue, well the honeymoon is long gone and weight is an issue. I am going to fresh install 10 and hopefully that will clean up performance some, but overall I am dissatisfied with this product. The WiFi connection is super crappy as well, good luck finding wifi.

Having come from an excellent T520 laptop that was due back on lease return, I found this latest large format laptop a massive step backwards from previous Lenovo offerings.  While the laptop has good performance, the ergonomics on the laptop are terrible, as was Lenovo's decision to change the AC power adapter plug design.  Have some extra 20v power adapters from previous generation Lenovo computers?  Too bad, while voltage and amperage remain identical to the previous generation of power adapters, they change the plug to a rectangular design ensuring new spares must be purchased.<br /><br />If you are someone who likes to keep your fingers on the home keys and use the TrackPoint and mouse buttons the new \"ClickPad\" touchpad on this device will drive you insane unless you disable the touchpad.  Why?  Because the touchpad and mouse buttons are integrated into one piece resulting in your mouse moving when you move your thumb over to left-click on the top-left corner of the touchpad.  Conversely, if you are a touchpad user, you are likely to be quite fond of the \"ClickPad\".<br /><br />Signs of cost-costing are everywhere on the computer including:<br /><br />- Super-thin materials and soft screws on the hard drive and memory covering door<br />- Thinner casing material overall that increases flex of all parts of case<br />- Zero status lights (no hard disk, battery or wireless lights) (Just a stupid illuminated dot in the \"ThinkPad\" logo on the back side of the laptop display (thanks for that form over function decision Lenovo))<br />- No latching mechanism for the display (though I suppose this was something that may have broken for some on old models)<br />- Flimsy CD tray<br /><br />Cost-cutting measures are probably inevitable in the ultra-competitive computer segment, but just beware that the once rock-solid feel to ThinkPad models of old is simply not here.  This leaves me with the following overall summary of the T540p model:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Excellent battery life<br />- Keyboard button to lock operating system (useful if you like to secure your computer before you walk away)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Thin, materials and easily damaged screws to hard drive access panel<br />- Poor speaker location (they are simply downward facing slits in the front of the case)<br />- Hardware specific functions shared with the function keys are now primary instead of secondary<br />- No longer any dedicated hardware buttons for volume, speaker and microphone mute or wireless<br />- Fixed CD/DVD drive means no Ultrabay option.  A big negative if you liked the ability to add a second internal hard drive as well as being able to easily swap out said second drive.<br />- Terrible \"ClickPad\" touchpad design for TrackPoint users results in left-click mouse button being too far left for activation with right thumb if you work that way<br /><br />Other things to be aware of:<br />- Hardware specific functions shared with the function keys are now primary instead of secondary which means if you use F5 for Refresh or F3 for Next in Windows a lot you will either be annoyed to have to press the Fn key as well or remember to press the Fn+Esc key to lock the FnLk key on to make Functions active.<br />- Windows 8.1 power management does not work well with some T540p models.  This may vary based on graphics processor and display panel chosen, but on my model you cannot dim the display and when the display is turned off by power management, the screen turns blank, but power is not actually cut (it glows dimly instead of actually being powered off).  These anomalies do not occur if you use Windows 7 or 8.<br />- The off-center keyboard is not an issue when the laptop is resting on a surface, but if you put it on your lap and use it from there you may find the offset annoying or less than natural feeling<br /><br />Overall, this is a very disappointing product and by far the worst ThinkPad laptop I have used in the last 10 years in terms of ergonomics and material quality.", "asin": "B00GK94M9K", "user_id": "AG2BNFXH2WL3LKJWO6UH4OLAIRPQ", "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": false, "main_category": "Computers", "average_rating": 3.5, "price": "269.0", "os": "Windows 8", "color": "Black", "brand": "Lenovo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "text": "Lenovo really upped their game with this redesign.

I finally boiled it down to between this, the ASUS ROG G750, and the MSI GE60 laptops.  In the end the tipping point was the video card as the 870m is the highest end mobile card unless you want to pay about five-hundred more for the current flagship the GTX 880m.  Apparently the 870 is noticeably better performing than the 860 (according to notebook check) which all the other gaming laptops have at this price point.  The processor is roughly equivalent to competing models, and while this model has less RAM it still has plenty and can more can be added later relatively inexpensively.<br /><br />Unfortunatelyl the first one I got was faulty and had to be returned as it randomly locked up whenever the video card was ran even moderately hard no matter the game or drivers used.  Luckily Amazon shipped a replacement immediately and this one has been a beast.  So far I have thrown Age of Wonders 3, Company of Heroes 2, Planetside 2, and Dawn of War 2 (a lot of sequels!) with max settings and still get above 50fps.  While none of these are bleeding edge games designed to push your card to the limits I am very satisfied with the performance on a mobile platform with modern games especially Planetside where things get hectic in large firefights.<br /><br />The sound is pretty great (I have never had a sub-woofer inside a laptop before), the keyboard is nice on the hands while being responsive and I especially like the amount of control you have over the back lit keyboard colors even if it is minor in the grand scheme of things.  The touchpad kind of sucks but that's because they blow in general and there isn't much help for that.  It does however automatically disable whenever it detects another pointing device which can be overridden by a handy physical key near the pad.  The screen is high-resolution and looks great out of the box and I haven't had to adjust anything yet.  I find the casing aesthetically pleasing, solid, and a bit flashy which a gaming rig aught to be.  The only 'downside' I have found so far is as a 17.3&#34; gaming laptop this thing is not light or small, and the power brick is the size of my foot.

They are totally unapologetic and act as if I've done something wrong.  They said &#34;did you install non MSI software?&#34; as if I wasn't supposed to use MS Office.  Both times when I sent in the computer I didn't hear anything for a month, and when I called they said they hadn't gotten it and acted like it was my fault unless I could produce a tracking number.  When I found my tracking number (I had just moved and it wasn't at my fingertips), they said they didn't have it at first but that they would look into it.  A few days later I got the laptop back in the mail.<br /> - The website is awful.  It's slow, hard to navigate, and it was hard to register the product.<br /> - Although they've replaced many of the components, twice, I still get really insidious errors when I'm doing work, and it looks like there's a problem with the application.  But, if I do anything remotely memory intensive, like install Windows updates, I'll get a BSOD.  (Blue Screen Of Death), which says that it's a hardware issue.  The upsetting part is that after two fixes I get BSODs frequently as soon as I've gotten the computer back.  This tells me they didn't test it.

It didn't have very many reviews and that made me a bit skeptical but I am SO glad I purchased this particular model!<br /><br />I am one of those people who read lots of reviews before buying anything. I was thinking about getting the 11.6 Acer because it had way more reviews. Someone rating this Chromebook mentioned the exterior being susceptible to dirt because it's white. That actually influenced me and it was totally unfounded. The casing is so strong that it feels like it could withstand just about anything and wipes clean so well. This is my second Chromebook--my first being the classic Samsung Chromebook I bought a couple of years ago. That one still works but was built very flimsily. It always irked me that the bevel was so cheaply made. This puppy is solid plastic. Recently my Chromebook dropped hard on the floor and was good to go. I don't even feel the need to carry it a protective case, although I try to use a padded backpack as often as possible. No scratches due to such a material for the cover. Awesome.<br /><br />I wanted a better viewing experience than my Chromebook. Verdict? Same deal. Matte screen, viewing angles no better. Solution? Watch videos straight ahead! LOL! Maybe someday I will also get the HD 15-inch Chromebook for that sort of thing but for now I am all good.<br /><br />The keyboard is very springy, which I love cuz my fingers can get to flying sometimes. Track pad is good. I bought a floor model of this on Amazon so guess how much I paid? Around $165! Can't beat it with a stick. $90 less than my first Samsung Chromebook (albeit used versus new but this was barely used. I sure can't tell.)<br /><br />Battery life is awesome.

The battery also last very long, even with the screen on full brightness. The keyboard is really nice, although it doesn't have several keys that most keyboards do (End, Home, Caps lock, Delete, etc). I had to learn the shortcuts to these, and that is fine.<br /><br />Since I also edit text, I need a mouse. The responsiveness to the mouse is a little slow, I find that the trackpad works much better than the mouse, but then again, highlighting is a pain without a mouse, so I am trying to find the perfect setting to it. That said, I dislike not being able to turn off the trackpad while the mouse is present.<br /><br />I also find that the power plug is a bit flimsy, so I recommend charging and unplugging while in use.

I read many of the reviews by computer sites and they didn't like the performance of the Acer but those reviews were written before Google updated Chrome OS to support the Nvidia processor. By the time I bought ours, the update was available and it was installed the first time I booted it up and it has run great, right from the get-go. I chose the lower res screen based on other reviews. Users were complaining about the small size of objects on the higher res screen. 13&#34; is pretty small to display 1080p.<br /><br />This is our second Chromebook. The first was a Samsung with an ARM processor that we bought 3 years ago so we weren't new to Chromebooks. (this Acer is much more powerful though).<br /><br />Chromebooks can do almost anything a Windows computer can do. In fact the only thing I use Windows for anymore is to run Quicken and if I switched to Mint.com then I could forget about Windows altogether. The most common complaint I see from people who haven't tried Chromebooks is that they fear living without Microsoft Office. All you need is an Outlook.com email account and you can use Microsoft's Office online for free. You can use it either with the free MS Onedrive (15GB storage in the cloud) or with your Dropbox account (just install the Dropbox Chrome extension). Of course, there is nothing wrong with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. They work if you're connected to the internet or not and they just look like the older MS Office 2003 apps. In my opinion they are better than the MS Office apps.<br /><br />Major advantages of Chrome OS over Windows.<br /><br />Chrome OS is a small operating system and runs well on cheaper hardware. If you had a bad experience with a Windows XP netbook you know they barely worked and once they were a couple of years old, they were so slow you regretted buying one. This is not a problem with Chromebooks.<br /><br />You don't need to install antivirus software.<br /><br />You don't need to defragment your hard drive.<br /><br />Updates are a much better experience on a Chromebook.<br /><br />Chromebooks don't slow down over time like Windows PC's do.<br /><br />Any apps you use are all web-based and therefor they are automatically updated. If you have a Windows computer with locally installed programs you have to manually update those and it's a comparative pain and if you don't update them you risk security problems.<br /><br />You can buy cheap Windows computers these days but that is only because of competition from Chromebooks and the cheap Chromebooks will outperform any cheap Windows machine.

If you want a 13&#34; laptop capable of running the latest games then it's a great option. It's not cheap, but contains some high quality components.<br /><br />Read on for a lot more detail:<br /><br />OVERALL CONSTRUCTION/BUILD<br /><br />My first impression on picking up this laptop is how light it is for a gaming laptop. Sure it's only 13&#34;, but I was expecting it to be feel more dense than it does at just around 4.5 pounds. The overall quality of the case is high. I would say that it's not quite as nice as the machined aluminum of a Macbook Pro, but it is light years ahead of some of the cheap plastic-feel laptops I have tried out. It definitely feels 'high quality' in your hands.<br /><br />The design features a glowing blue alien logo on the outside of the screen with a few glowing blue lines on a dark grey background. If you're looking for a &#34;professional&#34; looking laptop then this is probably not it, but considering it's branded with an alien theme - it's a lot more subtle than it could be. Personally I like the design.<br /><br />SCREEN This display on this laptop is a gorgeous 3200x1800 screen, and it looks awesome. The Amazon listing says the resolution is 2560x1440 pixels, but this is definitely incorrect - the one I got runs at 3200x1800 out of the box. The screen is bright and clear, and everyting I've tried out has looked great on it. I'm not personally a big fan of touch screens on laptops, but I tried it out for a while and everything I messed around with worked well. One reason I don't like touchscreens much is that I hate putting blemishes on my beautiful screen from oils off of my fingers, but I have to admit that even after using the touchscreen for a while there isn't really any noticible smudging at all. One minor annoyance with the touchscreen is that flicking away a bit of dust on the screen ends up opening up menus or moving my cursor. Not a knock on this specific product at all, just a personal preference.<br /><br />One thing to note is that with the 3200x1800 resolution on a 13&#34; screen, this laptop scales up content through Windows settings by default. Through &#34;Display&#34; -&#62; &#34;Make text and other items larger or smaller&#34; the default setting puts the scale up all the way. Most programs handle this scaling well, but it's possible that you will run into one that doesn't (like thie &#34;Alienware Product Registration&#34; that pops up, the text is microscopic). This isn't a knock on the laptop, just the reality of running such a high resolution on a smaller screen.<br /><br />KEYBOARD<br />The keyboard is surprisingly comfortable considering they had to cram it into a 13 inch laptop. The keys feel nice to the touch, and the space is used well. I'm especially happy to see that they found room for page up, page down, home, end, and delete keys. I use these keys often while programming, and I'm glad they're here. So far I've accidentally hit the page up/down keys a little too often, but I just need to get used to the keyboard. The palm rests are smooth and comfortable.<br /><br />There are also lots of customizable keyboard backlight options if that's your thing.<br /><br />TRACKPAD<br />The trackpad on this machine is not very good, it's the biggest negative in my experience with this product. It works alright I guess, but it's not anywhere near as smooth as the one on my Macbook Pro. Given that this is a only 13&#34; laptop, the trackpad is a good size and fairly comfortable to use - but the texture of the pad is a little rougher than I'd like and this leads to scrolling that's just not completely smooth - the cursor tends to jump and skip a bit as you move it across the screen. Right-clicking is also a little finicky, sometimes I end up left-clicking when I intend to right-click. Gestures work fairly well with one major exception:<br /><br />After setup I installed Chrome and started browsing around the web. The gesture behavior was extremely buggy in Chrome. It almost seemed completely random. Sometimes it would scroll correctly, sometimes it would snap the page to the top or bottom, it would often draw strange rectangles everywhere as I gestured. This behavior did NOT happen in Internet Explorer or Firefox, just Chrome. I tried to resolve it through driver updates but didn't have any luck. After research, it looks like the problem is with Chromium specifically, but I haven't been able to figure out a workaround. Here are two threads that have information on the topic:<br /><br />https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/BdaUw9boNSU<br />https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463350<br /><br />As a result, I'm not able to use Chrome at all, which is a definite bummer because Chrome is my usual browser of choice. I've been using Firefox and the scrolling works very well, but I'm disappointed I can't use Chrome.<br /><br />SPEAKERS<br />When I turned the volume all the way up on this laptop, I was honestly shocked at how loud these speakers are. It is MUCH louder than my 17&#34; Macbook Pro. The quality is decent, it doesn't compare to a nice Sonos speaker or anything - but it's excellent for a 13&#34; laptop. Not much bass, but boy are they loud.<br /><br />GAMES<br />If you're buying this computer then it's highly likely that you're a gamer. I've tried it out on a bunch of different games, I'll talk about them here. The framerates are GENERAL ideas of the fps I was getting, obviously these fluctuate a lot during gameplay. I used MSI Afterburner to get the numbers.<br /><br />Far Cry 4<br /><br />I loaded up Far Cry 4 and it crashed immediately after launching! Bummer! I spent a while on this until I found a random forum post that said that MSI Afterburner causes Far Cry 4 to crash, and sure enough they were correct. Unfortunately that means that I don't have actual fps time data for Far Cry 4. I can tell you that it autodetected 1920x1080 on High, and this was running fairly well - but I scaled it back to Medium and the gameplay was a lot smoother. I'll stick with medium.<br /><br />Fallout: New Vegas<br /><br />Fallout: New Vegas autodetected 1280x720 on High quality, and it ran at a solid 60 fps. I scaled it up to 1920x1080 at Ultra quality and it ran between 40-60 fps.<br /><br />Civilization V<br /><br />Civilization V is a good example of what I mentioned earlier in the review: Some applications just aren't built to run at such high resolutions. Civ V autodetected 3200x1800 and the main menu was all weird, centered in between big black emptiness in the middle of the screen (Some people talkig about it here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/0/864980734944032303/). The actual game worked ok though, but only ran at about 12 fps. I scaled the resolution down to 1920x1080 and it went up to about 20-22 fps. Frame rate isn't as important in an RTS as in an FPS, but there you go.<br /><br />The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings<br /><br />The Witcher 2 autodetected 3200x1800 at Low quality and ran at about 20 fps. I scaled it down to 1920x1080 and the framerate jumped to 35-50. I upped the quality from low to high and ended up with 22-32 frames per second. I'll also note that The Witcher 2 consistently crashed for me whenver I exited it, not sure why.<br /><br />BENCHMARKS<br />If you're into benchmarks, I ran a few with this machine right out of the box. I didn't try to optimize these scores at all, they are just what I got with the vanilla machine:<br /><br />3DMark<br />Sky Diver 1.0: 9209<br />Fire Strike 1.1: 3352<br /><br />I also timed reboot, and it was just around 10 seconds. Very fast.<br /><br />BATTERY<br /><br />It's hard to give information about battery life because tasks vary so wildly, but I just had a battery charge last a little over 4 hours through some web browsing, video watching, and programming.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />I decided to go with 5 stars for this laptop because I think for the correct customer it's an awesome product. I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could due to the lower-quality trackpad discussed above, but I don't feel it's worth taking off a full star for. I've put a lot of information in this review, and I hope it's enough to help you figure out if this is the right laptop for you. If there are any specific questions then leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to respond. I'll also be updating the review in the future as I use the laptop more and more.

Alienware is a pricier, upgraded gaming line from Dell.<br /><br />I bought a new Toshiba laptop last year, after years of living with a Gateway that was so bad it isn't even funny. The Toshiba laptop was a big upgrade for me, but it was nothing compared to this.<br /><br />The design is unique and interesting and fun. It comes in a large box with an alien emblazoned on the top. When you open it, the laptop's unique design is the first thing you will notice. The top corners are slanted and this makes it a lot easier to manipulate and hold.<br /><br />When you open the laptop, you will notice a small alien head centered above the keyboard. This is the power switch. Plug it in, the plug is highlighted with blue. Turn on the laptop, the keyboard has a blue backlight.<br /><br />There is a facial recognition password program provided as a trial. It is pretty neat, but it is a trial and you will have to pay to make it permanent. The benefit of this is that it should work for all the programs on your computer. I am opting to not buy this, so I can't tell you how well that part works. But for the initial login, it works well. If it can't read your face, because of insufficient lighting, there is a traditional password backup.<br /><br />Once I got going, the laptop pretty quickly and very easily transferred files and programs from my old Toshiba laptop through a Miscrosoft interface.<br /><br />The screen quickly resembled my old screen in layout, making operation easy.<br /><br />The big difference here is that the laptop has a touchscreen. Frankly, I am still getting used to this, but it does seem a lot easier to navigate and use. My husband has an Ipad and he is very familiar with this and frequently kids me about using the old trackpad.<br /><br />The resolution of the screen is brilliant. It is clear and the colors are vivid, making my old laptop feel like it had a standard definition screen and this has a high-def.<br /><br />For gaming, the Alienware seems to be great. I play an online game and the graphics are much more vivid and interesting. The game also seems to move faster, given the faster processors on this laptop.

There are a lot of things to recommend this line generally, but as a user of previous versions, I have to say I'm not impressed.  Let's count the ways:<br /><br />- I bought the add-in hard drive bay for the ultrabay.  Of course since the thing got thinner the form factor on this stuff has changed.  No big surprise there, but the mechanism they designed for locking the 2.5&#34; drive into the bay doesn't work.  The drive at some point works its way free of the SATA connector and fails.  You have to unscrew the backplate (fun when you're on the road and don't have that screwdriver) to fix this since you can't jus eject the thing like you could with older devices.  Personally I've &#34;fixed&#34; it by jamming some foam into the slot between the bay and the drive so it stays attached.  Stupid.<br /><br />- Remember the rubber bands they had that you slid onto the side of your hard drive to put it into the laptop?  Nope, those are gone.  So if you still use spinning media its just going to jiggle around or slam into the floor when you drop this thing.  Again, older versions were better about this stuff.<br /><br />- Then lets talk about that missing ultrabay removal switch.  As I said you have to unscrew a backplate now and undo a very small screw and then push on the screwhole with your screwdriver (!) to eject the drive.  Seriously?<br /><br />- In general the keyboard is worse than before.  The 10-key pad is RIGHT NEXT to the other keys, so you'll often hit the calculator key or the numlock key when you meant to hit delete or backspace.  Yuck.  Getting used to it but if you're a programmer you're going to be frustrated with this thing.<br /><br />- The older docks used to &#34;click&#34; into place.  With this generation you're never quite sure if its actually connected or not.<br /><br />- The battery life is *still* pretty poor.  Not sure why when other laptops are getting better all the time.  Not a big problem for me, but still...<br /><br />But hey, its pretty thin and acceptably light.  Its still got a stiff metal frame.  The display is really decent.

I'm an embedded hardware and software developer (Embedded System Resources) and spend a lot of time in front of a computer, often using demanding applications such as CAD and FPGA design.  But as a consultant, I sometimes travel, so for the last ten years, my primary machine has been a laptop.  When in the office it is in a docking station with an external keyboard, mouse and monitor.  The W541 is a very fast machine (i7 quad core).  The external monitor I am driving is a 55 inch 4K.  The computer came with a hard drive that I replaced with a 500 GB SSD.  I also upgraded it from 8 GB RAM to 24 GB RAM and to Windows 10.  It ran W10 fine on 8 GB, but when I started thinking about virtual machines and stuff--well the extra memory was less than $100.<br />Part of what I like about this computer is that it is extremely capable without the dock.  The build in keyboard is one of the nicest I've ever seen on a laptop.  The touchpad has multi-touch capability for things like dragging (scrolling) and includes a pressure switch that can do left or right mouse clicks by just pushing on the touch pad.  I miss it when its docked!  The display is large for a laptop and full 1920 x 1080 HD.  The battery life is probably 6 hours in my usage case.  I've used it on some fairly long domestic flights without ever running it down.  The fingerprint reader is quite responsive.  The mini display port/firewire is a useful feature.  Overall just a very well thought out design.<br />Are there any negatives?  A few.  The video is a hybrid of Intel (on chip) and Nvidia.  The interaction between the two isn't quite what I would expect.  I would prefer to see it put more emphasis on the Nvidia when running on A/C power (including docked).  Also, while it has many video options when docked, one has to review them carefully, because there are limitations and interactions.  It can drive at least three monitors, but only certain types and certain resolutions on each port.  Even the internal mini DP can drive a 4K monitor, but only with exactly the right combination of ports and cables.  It was frustrating to initially learn the matrix and obtain the correct cables for the method that worked.  Also, all this power doesn't come free.  It is one of the heavier laptops on the market, and the power supply is at least twice the size and weight of my previous laptop's.  A laptop that may need over 200 Watts under certain circumstances has to have a power supply that can handle it.  Lenovo has been a bit too cautious, in my opinion, about power supply requirements.  I wouldn't mind traveling with a smaller PS, knowing that it might not put much charge in my batteries while running, or might even be depending a bit on batteries to meet peak demand.  I could always top it off overnight in the hotel.<br />But overall, I am very pleased with this computer.

With incredibly lifelike modeling and rendering (you can practically count the pores on characters faces), a wide range of immersive environments with real-time effects (blowing leaves, running water, etc.), and plenty of intrigue to keep both Holmes and Watson busy, the game most certainly is afoot.<br /><br />Crimes and Punishments is not a linear story; rather, it is made up of six separate games loosely connected by the appearance of the Merry Men, a gang of terrorists. Several of the stories are taken from canon (Black Peter, Abbey Grange).<br /><br />As you play through the first case, on-screen guidance explains the gameplay basics. As Sherlock, you have several tools at your disposal, including a research library of encyclopedias and newspapers, a laboratory where you will be required to perform different types of chemical analyses, and Toby, the best nose in the British empire. You also have a full wardrobe of potential disguises including a makeup table; this will be of importance at several points in the game. At certain points, you have the chance to switch between Sherlock and Watson, a constable, and Toby, the \u201cbest nose in the British Empire.\u201d<br /><br />There are several new features here from previous installments of Frogwares\u2019 series, including Sherlock's mind palace, where you visually connect glowing synapses as new clues are unearthed, leading you to a series of possible conclusions as to the culprit(s). Depending on the conclusions you reach, various suspects will be pronounced guilty. Sherlock then has the additional responsibility of deciding whether to arrest or absolve each killer. Another feature is Sherlock's in-depth analysis of characters; you have the ability to slowly pan over each suspect, and Sherlock points out various facts that will enable you to unlock key plot points based on these observations. Sherlock also has two additional tools in his arsenal; one allowed you to observe details that others would miss (this is accomplished through a filter than also distorts background sounds), and the other allows you to mentally recreate an object (this is a mini puzzle in itself as each \u201cmental object\u201d requires manipulation to function).<br /><br />The locations range from grimy London alleys to Roman ruins, elaborate Chinese temples, and stately manors. Each felt totally unique and distinct from the others; in fact I was floored by the attention to detail and number of explorable areas as other detective games I have played give a much smaller venue.  In addition to puzzles (which range from frequently easy to very difficult), there are a series of mini-games that involve boxing, archery, chemical analysis, recreating objects, and a whole lot of lockpicking. These mini games can be skipped, which will drastically shorten the length of the game. It\u2019s also obvious that the mini games were designed with console gaming in mind, as accomplishing some of them on a computer keyboard (without a joypad) is pretty much impossible, but I was able to accomplish most of them successfully.<br /><br />I found the length of the cases to be a bit uneven; for example, the first, second, and fourth cases felt shorter in comparison to the other three. I also felt the second case was the weakest of the six as the locations all felt extremely repetitive and I had deduced the basic plot very early into my investigation. The disguise feature is a great idea, but it seems to only have an effect at a couple of points in the game; it would have been interesting to see how suspects and NPCs reacted to Sherlock depending on his outfit at a given time. I would have also liked to see greater weight placed on the morality system; you are notified if you made the correct deduction, then told what percentage of fellow Steam gamers made the same judgment call. Once you make a final decision, the game erases all save points for that case, so if you want to see various endings, be sure to do so BEFORE accepting the final decision.<br /><br />There are also a number of awards that can be earned for accomplishing various cases, conversations, and minigames, which adds to the replay value.<br /><br />Voice acting was generally excellent, with dialogue that felt true to the characters and the period. The banter between Sherlock and Watson (and Sherlock's jibes at Lestrade and his brother Mycroft) felt true to the original stories. Even Mrs. Hudson makes an appearance, as do the Baker Street Irregulars and Bill Wiggins, who play a key role in several of the cases.<br /><br />Fans of BBC Sherlock, the original Conan Doyle stories, and detective novels in general (especially if you are a fan of the older Agatha Christie PC games as I am) will find much to recommend Sherlock; the graphics are simply stunning, the environments are totally immersive, and the replay value is high as there are so many potential outcomes, optional clues, minigames, and awards to earn. This is truly one of the best and most impressive PC games I have played in the last decade.", "images": [], "asin": "B00KQCOK2Q", "parent_asin": "B00LINQ1HY", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1417645982000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "I think I'll stick to the free version - too basic and did not detect recent infections", "text": "I had a free version of McAfee provided through AT&T that I had been using for many years until I was offered the chance to try the Total Protection version; so far, my computer has been infected with several adware / malware outbreaks that McAfee did not catch (instead, I had to resort to downloading and running Malwarebytes and SpyBot).

I loved the combination of culture, history, and mystery in these games.<br /><br />In Ghost of Thornton Hall, Nancy is called upon to find Jessalyn Thornton, a missing bride-to-be on Blackrock Island, ancestral home of the Thornton family. Thornton Hall is a dilapidated antebellum mansion flanked by skeletal moss-draped trees and a crypt / graveyard. Like CRY, you'll spend the entire game at night, which means lots of dark lighting (and ambiance). As other reviewers have pointed out, GTH felt a bit like a mashup of [[ASIN:B003BHGWMY Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and Legend of the Crystal Skull (missing bride-to-be + lots of time spent in graveyards / crypts).<br /><br />You'll spend much of the game untangling two separate mysteries: piecing together the puzzle of the missing bride-to-be as well as the death of Charlotte Thornton, whose ghost is said to haunt Blackrock Island. Nancy has the chance to interrogate several members of the Thornton family, although I would have liked to see more actual snooping (there's definitely much less snooping than in earlier games...and where do these people sleep / eat since no one apparently has a room at the house?).<br /><br />You're limited to three main locations; I would have liked a couple of extra rooms to explore within Thornton Hall (one humorous random ND moment: there's a tea set where you can make yourself unlimited tea, and then I realized that this was one of the few games without a bathroom!). A few more hotspots would have been nice, too (Jessalyn's purse is on the floor, but you can't explore it. Wait, shouldn't there be some evidence in there??). However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.<br /><br />SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it. Creepy events happen in every room at any moment, and combined with the eerie music (which has a great vocal / cello soundtrack), keep you on the edge of your seat. For me, the biggest cop-out was the supposed explanation for these at the end of the game...which wouldn't have explained all the sightings anyway. The game was morbid more than scary; there are several surprisingly dark subplots and possible endings for an ND game, and several of the conversations involve some pretty black humor on the part of one character in particular.<br /><br />The puzzles offered sufficient variety, but I would have liked to see more use made of the ghost hunting equipment that Savannah Woodham left for Nancy; it's pretty obvious that the hauntings are off the charts, but you only use it for one puzzle and then you're done (SAW was great about using EVP recorders and the like to try and capture evidence).<br /><br />If you're stuck, you can use the hint feature if you're playing as an Amateur Sleuth. Another cool touch is that there are three possible endings depending on how you play out the final scenario. It was fun playing through all three to see the different endings, which also added replay value. One feature that I liked was that you can instantly see which awards you've earned throughout the course of the game using the new trophy menu display; each time you earn a new award, you'll get a notification (there are A LOT of possible awards this time around, adding to the replay value). And there's FINALLY a feature that lets you fast-forward through conversations, which is especially handy if you're replaying the game.<br /><br />The game's atmosphere, music, graphics and story were great; it's definitely one of the best games from the last couple of years post-SAW, but it still seemed short compared to earlier games like Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge. However, if you're a fan of \"spooky\" ND games like Mystery in a Haunted Mansion, Legend of the Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge, you'll love Ghost of Thornton Hall!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plot<br />Graphics<br />Music<br />Creepy atmosphere<br />New features (fast-forward through conversations, new trophy menu)<br />Replay value<br /><br />Cons:<br />Seemed short<br />Could have benefitted from a few extra rooms / locations to explore<br />You spend a lot of time backtracking, especially later in the game<br />Contains some pretty heavy / dark topics for younger players", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BiW82pTBL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BiW82pTBL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BiW82pTBL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31zeBQ95cbL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31zeBQ95cbL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31zeBQ95cbL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ix23QRZWL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ix23QRZWL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ix23QRZWL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SFZTkpPKL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SFZTkpPKL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SFZTkpPKL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sZpKLIH2L._SL1600_.png", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sZpKLIH2L._SL800_.png", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sZpKLIH2L._SL256_.png"}], "asin": "B00C9UND8U", "parent_asin": "B00C9UND8U", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1368526532000, "helpful_vote": 30, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Beautiful, but tedious.", "text": "To sum up this game in one word: tedious. That's unfortunate, since there was so much that could have been done with the setting and theme.<br /><br />**First impressions...**<br /><br />The first thing you notice is that the traditional \"Nancy's desk\" intro is gone. So, too, is any sort of exposition; I felt as if I'd just been dropped into the desert with no backstory or idea of what was going on. As you have conversations with the suspects and phone friends, you start to put the pieces together, but that came fairly late in the game for me.<br /><br />Most notably, there are very few settings and few hotspots to interact with. There are really only two main locations, the campsite and the tomb. You can pan around the camp, but despite several close-up shots, there's rarely anything to click on. Some background animations (palm branches waving in the desert wind, perhaps some glowing embers from the campfire, scuttling scarabs) would have done wonders to bring the dig site to life. Inside the main tent, it feels like wasted space. You can't pan, and there's nothing to explore inside the bunks. Even items that seemed like they should be explorable (like a purse left out in the open) aren't clickable. You see shelves in the tent; my first thought was, \"aha, supplies!\" but once again, there's no hotspots. There are several snooping puzzles that require you to go through personal belongings, and as mentioned above, there's hardly anything clickable despite lots of potential \"hotspots\" (a digital camera that I was sure would have incriminating evidence, a voice recorder like the one from SAW, but I couldn't click on either).<br /><br />**Puzzles**<br /><br />The puzzles are tedious; it felt like all I kept doing was finding and translating hieroglyphs. On the Amateur Sleuth level, you can skip all the hieroglyph translation by clicking on the \"quick translate\" button. Even some of the puzzles shamelessly repeat themselves during the course of the game. You're given several archeological tools appropriate for a dig site; it's a shame that the game didn't require you to make more use of them.<br /><br />I kept getting lost in the tunnels. True, you're given a map, but it lacks a \"you are here\" feature, and the tunnels look very similar in some cases. More importantly, there was no sense of foreboding, no sense that Nancy really is being stalked by an otherworldly curse. Nancy debunks the \"curse\" events almost immediately after they happen, which takes away any sense of suspense that would have otherwise been generated. I felt no sense of urgency, no hair standing up on the back of my neck, nothing that seemed creepy/spooky like the yurei in [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]] (watery footprints, ghostly reflections, etc.).<br /><br />The character rendering and animation was generally good, but some of the mannerisms (Dylan's constantly putting his arm behind his head, Abdullah's accent) were grating and repetitive. Two of the character accents were particularly grating; Abdullah sounded like a close cousin of Antonio Banderas channeling Puss in Boots, and Jamila sounded like she just stepped out of a British boarding school (both are supposed to be Egyptian).<br /><br />**Chatting up the suspects**<br /><br />It didn't seem like there were many conversation branches to pursue, and some of the follow-up questions didn't make sense (a character would spend two or three minutes giving an answer, and the next question was \"why are you here?\").<br /><br />Some of the scripted conversations seemed a bit questionable. One involved a crack about the British Empire, and the other involved a scenario that sounded a lot like the Book of Revelation and the Rapture, if you subscribe to that sort of thing. This surprised me, as ND games are generally neutral towards political and religious themes.<br /><br />Character-wise, there seems to be more depth and backstory than in many ND games, and the ending is brilliant; you're never quite sure who the villain is until the very end (shades of Agatha Christie here).<br /><br />**Setting**<br /><br />I feel let down that modern-day Egypt was completely overlooked. Unlike [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] or [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]], where you had traditional foods, games, etc. from Italy and Japan, there's nothing to tie TMB to modern Egypt, only the ancient past. You only deal with hieroglyphs and no modern Arabic. A little of both would have worked wonders. It would have been awesome for Nancy to visit a traditional Cairo souk (market), ride a camel to see the pyramids and Sphynx at Giza (even a cutscene would have sufficed) or have to travel between the dig site and a museum to interview / look for clues. Instead, you're confined to one location with few people to talk to, mostly phone friends, which grew old quickly, but the remoteness of the dig site is a central part of the plot.<br /><br />The problem with TMB is that the temples and Egyptian artifacts lack any kind of context or historical explanation. I would have preferred to see TMB be more like [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]], where Nancy was an intern in a museum. There, the educational games felt natural and I learned a lot at the same time. Another good example of the ancient Egyptian genre is [[ASIN:B0017AJMX8 Dracula Origin]]; it had one part that was set in modern Egypt; there you got to hunt for artifacts in the museum, translate hieroglyphs, and it was actually fun.<br /><br />**The new interface**<br /><br />I thought the new interface worked well and made it easy to access important information. The Hints Hotline was in use almost constantly, since I was frequently stuck (it progressively gives you hints until you have the option to see the full solution; this is done in red font, so you can avoid seeing the complete solution if you choose).<br /><br />Also, I  had some issues with the scrolling text boxes during conversations. The letters on the left-hand side kept getting chopped off, so you'd have to guess at the first letter or two of words. Not a major issue, but a bit annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />There are also phone charms to collect, but these seemed totally out of place in Ancient Egypt. In SAW, when you're in Japan, cell phone charms are all the rage and it makes sense to see them in the game, but it seemed out of place in an Egyptian tomb.<br /><br />**Final verdict:**<br /><br />Since I've always been interested in Egypt, there is some replay value; the graphics are simply gorgeous, and you'll see plenty of familiar names and faces from Ancient Egyptian culture, but if you're looking for edge-of-your seat drama like SAW, sadly Nancy won't find it in Egypt. The plot kind of grew on me as the game progressed, but more explorable areas, particularly above-ground, would have gone a long way to making TMB feel less claustrophobic.<br /><br />The teaser for ND27 looks promising!<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Beautiful graphics<br />+ Music<br />+ Ancient Egyptian culture<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Accents<br />- Lack of hotspots / animation<br />- Lack of areas to explore<br />- Repetitive puzzles", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HecsYnBaL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HecsYnBaL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HecsYnBaL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HzNmB5sTL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HzNmB5sTL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HzNmB5sTL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KS6QD13TL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KS6QD13TL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KS6QD13TL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jeaGU6HgL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jeaGU6HgL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jeaGU6HgL._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "B007PLR9UG", "parent_asin": "B007XJ448A", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1336514048000, "helpful_vote": 22, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A fine return to form in Nancy's 23rd outing...", "text": "Shadow at the Water's Edge (SAW) is Nancy Drew's 23rd mystery with Her Interactive, and it's one of the most impressive in terms of story, puzzles, and spooky ambience. Nancy is taking a well-deserved vacation at the Ryokan Hiei, a traditional inn in Kyoto, Japan. From the moment Nancy arrives, there are spooky omens, and the Shimizu family isn't very talkative about the family tragedy that hangs over the ryokan. Part of Nancy's job is to teach English through the Japan Teacher Exchange program, so you'll have various homework assignments to grade in the evenings. Because you're teaching all day, the game takes place at night, adding to the creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />Shadow at the Water's Edge is one of the scariest games next to Curse of Blackmoor Manor (note that the game is rated E (10+), so there's no gore or violence, but there are some heart-stopping moments). Various paranormal phenomena follow Nancy as she attempts to discover the secrets hiding inside the ryokan, and these were genuinely scary, since several were still unexplained after the finale. This is also one of the longest Nancy Drew games, with ample opportunity for sleuthing, snooping, and interviewing. You'll have the opportunity to hop on the subway as well as conduct phone interviews in your quest for the truth behind the hauntings.<br /><br />The game designers did a good job on incorporating Japanese culture into the game. You'll find Harajuku-inspired fashion, traditional Japanese gardens, cute cell phone charms, and customizable cell phone avatars that you can assign to your cell contacts (design enough, and you can win an award at the end of the game). I loved the little authentic touches, like the very Japanese hot water heater perched over Yumi's apartment sink. Nancy also has a Japanese-English dictionary to help her translate written items. The in-game music ranges from soothing, traditional Japanese instrumentals to ominous taiko drumming and sudden, eerie starts and stops that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />Gameplay is nonlinear. You can advance the game by setting your cell phone alarm; some actions can only be accomplished at certain times. There are numerous logic puzzles based on Japanese favorites like sudoku, renograms, and nonograms, along with several Japanese cultural lessons offered. If you're not a fan of sudoku and math puzzles, consider yourself warned, as you'll spend most of the game solving a variety of them. This is also one of the more difficult Nancy Drew games; I played the game on the Junior level, and ended up resorting to a walkthrough. Because of the two difficulty levels (Junior and Senior Detective), length of the game and the many opportunities for exploration (including at least three Easter eggs), the replay value is high.<br /><br />The team at Her Interactive obviously listened to fan feedback; gone are the endless list of chores and filler puzzles (you have the option to complete additional puzzles, but aren't required to do so). Nancy actually gets to snoop around...at night. There's a definite sense of danger; you can die, but there's a handy second chance feature. All of the suspects have something to hide; you'll find your opinion constantly changing based on what you unearth in your explorations. The finale (there are two possible endings based on how you react) was satisfying, as was the trailer for the next game in the series. This is the perfect game to play on Halloween and a fine return to form for Her Interactive.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31+T8yGMEqL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31+T8yGMEqL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31+T8yGMEqL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31RyJRrrxuL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31RyJRrrxuL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31RyJRrrxuL._SL256_.jpg"}, {"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31mRJRjacTL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31mRJRjacTL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31mRJRjacTL._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "B0041CASX2", "parent_asin": "B0041CASX2", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1287540492000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A fun (if short) romp inspired by the works of Poe.", "text": "\"Warnings at Waverly Academy\" (WAC) is Nancy Drew's 21st adventure with HerInteractive.

Some of the girls have been getting threatening notes from \"the Black Cat,\" which are then followed by malicious accidents. Nancy, as Becca Sawyer, has been asked by the school's headmistress to investigate.<br /><br />Unlike the previous installments [[ASIN:B001ANDJJU Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and [[ASIN:B0026EV5FW Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Ships]], there are five characters (suspects) that you have to befriend: Izzy Romero, Mel Corbalis, Leela Yadav, Corine Myers, and Rachel Hubbard. True, the girls fall into somewhat predictable stereotypes (the jock, the Queen Bee, the Goth girl), but they've been given distinct personalities with backstories.<br /><br />The first comparison that springs to mind is the benchmark of Nancy Drew games, [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]]. The game is not nearly as long (or difficult!) as Blackmoor Manor. Other than the fact that both games take place in drafty Gothic buildings, there's really not much in common.<br /><br />The school grounds are compact and make for easy (if limited) exploration. Inside the school, you have access to about ten or so rooms during the course of the game, along with limited space outside. I would have liked to see more areas to explore, particularly outside (there's an inviting-looking gazebo I kept wanting to explore). The puzzles fit well into the storyline. There's some filler in the form of \"you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\" puzzles; if Nancy wants access to a particular item, she has to do something for another girl first. But these puzzles fit well and are subject-related (a science puzzle, a math problem or two). You're also responsible for working in the school's snack shop (you have to do it at least once a (game) day or you get demerits).  You can die (there's a handy Second Chance feature) or get expelled (say, for pulling the fire alarm, too many noise violations, picking locks, or sneaking out at night), but it's smooth sailing for the most part.<br /><br />Even though Nancy has had plenty of techno-tools in her arsenal in previous games, WAC felt totally current: you keep in touch with the other girls via Twitter, there's mention of MySpace (called URSpace), and part of your job is to help with the school's website. HerInteractive even did a cool \"Watching Waverly\" Twitter soap opera before the game's launch (the Twitter script can be read at  twitter dot com/HerInteractive/watchingwaverly And the school has a \"website\" at warningsatwaverlyacademy dot com (the campus map got my hopes up that it would be explorable).<br /><br />Overall, WAC was short, but fun. You really get a feel for the girls, the school, and the mystery. The historical storyline tied in well with the overall theme. The graphics look great, particularly the character animations (special mention to the modeling of Rachel; I thought I was watching a movie during cutscenes, she was so realistic). The music was perfect without being intrusive. There's a fun Easter Egg that you can find (there's probably more), and references to earlier ND games (including the ever-present Koko Kringles). And there's not much in the way of scare factor, so this is a good choice for younger gamers (much less of an emphasis on the supernatural than Blackmoor or [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]]).", "images": [], "asin": "B002F8TD1W", "parent_asin": "B002F8TD1W", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1256988261000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Singing gondoliers, gelato, nightclubs and sleuthing, oh my!", "text": "In Nancy's eighteenth adventure from HerInteractive, Nancy makes good use of her passport in her second international outing, this time to Venice, Italy during Carnevale.

The mysterious Phantom escapes detection, having knowledge of the security systems for each site.<br /><br />Nancy's home base is Prudence's old palazzo, the Ca' Nascosta, now in a sad state of disrepair after Prudence sold it to a penny-pinching, ladder-climbing socialite.

You carry an Italian dictionary, which comes in useful for translating signs and documents. The background audio includes several conversations in Italian, but if you don't speak Italian, these aren't crucial to the game.

Also included are several flavors of Italian gelato, the Italian card game Scopa, the various Carnevale masks, and Venetian architecture.<br /><br />Nancy is working with the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's version of the FBI, to track the Phantom. Because it's Carnevale season, there aren't enough officers to tail him, so Nancy is given a PDA with tracking capabilities. There are several possible suspects, including Antonio Fango, the shady IT dealer who works across from Nancy's temporary residence, Enrico Tazza , a member of the Machiano Crime Syndicate and a fence for stolen goods , Colin, who has past secrets to hide, and the mysterious (and ungracious) hostess La Contessa Margherita Fauberg. Nancy has three modes of transportation: on foot (free), via vaporetto (water taxi, free), or by singing gondolier (between five and fifteen euros per trip). The main map is clearly laid out and is easy to navigate.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B0009X6QJM Nancy Drew: Secret Of the Old Clock]], Nancy must earn money in order to purchase items needed in her investigation, including books and costume accessories. You begin the game with 200 Euros, and if you budget very wisely, you won't need extra money (those fashionable shopping trips, gelato cones and singing gondoliers really add up!). If you find yourself running short, there are several ways to earn extra income, including dancing in a nightclub dressed as a slinky black cat (!).I loved the variety of the nightclub dancing, although the character animation was jerky and I would have liked to see Nancy move more than just rotating her wrist in-between moves. From my own experience, you can earn between two to over thirty euros per dance depending on how well you nail the cues (for the hearing-impaired: the dance cues are auditory, but flashing colored lights also tell you which colored button to press).<br /><br />I played the game on the Senior Detective level, which offers fewer step-by-step hints (there's no to-do list, for one) and more difficult puzzles, and the majority of the puzzles were sufficiently intuitive, but still challenging. The graphics are gorgeous as always; in scenes of the canals, visible from your bedroom balcony, the water ripples in real time. If you choose to ride a gondola (the amount varies depending on the gondolier), you're treated to a combination of still photos of Venice and rendered scenery which proves quite effective (along with the various Italian-language serenades taken from Italian opera and popular songs). Unlike some prior greats such as [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]] and [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]], the actual story in \"Phantom of Venice\" is spread a bit thin; the game could have benefitted from one or two additional suspects. But the variety of puzzles, some of which are new to the series (stakeouts, tracking, jewel heists), and the inclusion of Italian culture make up for these shortcomings.", "images": [], "asin": "B0018XU9SQ", "parent_asin": "B003DNSR3S", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1231644885000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lots of atmosphere, but low on vampires", "text": "Microids Dracula 3: Path of the Dragon is the sequel to its two earlier games [[ASIN:B0017HIH78 Microids: Dracula 1 & 2 DJC]]. The protagonist is Father Arno Moriani, a priest sent by the Vatican to investigate a local Transylvanian doctor who is slated for sainthood. But his seemingly simple investigation into the good doctor takes several unpredictable twists, and he soon finds himself plunged headfirst into a world of shadowy vampires, a battle that threatens not only his faith but also his life.<br /><br />The main failing of the game is the *absence* of vampires; you only deal directly with the title character at the very end of a long and tiring journey. The rest of the time, you're researching obscure texts, closely examining artwork, and leafing through hefty tomes of Romanian history that deal with the origins of Dracula, or Vlad Tepes. There are also undercurrents of WWII even though the game is set in 1920 (yep, evil Nazis and bad German accents!). There are only a handful of characters, but the ones you do interact with are generally fleshed out, with unique personalities and solid voicework.<br /><br />The puzzles themselves are some of the better ones I've seen in the last few years; there's a wide variety of strategy board games, locks, word puzzles, and inventory-based puzzles. Phlebotomy takes up a large part of the game; if you're squeamish, you probably won't go for the graphic how-to on drawing your own blood several times (\"now all that's left is to push the needle deep into the vein!\"), or poring over cells under a microscope.  Generally, the solutions are quite obvious, although one of the end puzzles requires careful observation and piecing together clues collected throughout the game. One of the features which could have been better utilized was the Bible passages; whenever your character is stressed out (you'll hear his heart beating loudly), you can flip open the Bible to an underlined passage that is directly related to the situation at hand. This action isn't necessary, however, and could have been made a more central element directly related to protecting Father Arno's faith (and sanity).<br /><br />The graphics are lushly drawn, bringing to life the war-torn village with its bombed-out  buildings. Ghostly howls ricochet down the empty streets. The lushness of Budapest is a direct contrast to war-ravaged Romania, and you visit rural Turkey as well. Character animations are effective, and the cutscenes are downright gorgeous, with a hazy, dreamlike quality (you're able to replay videos through the gallery feature on the main menu). The only disappointment was the ending; after so many hours of research and daring escapes, the final confrontation was brief and disappointing. The end cinematics were great, though, and leave openings for future installments.  Overall, this is a solidly crafted adventure with loads of atmosphere and political intrigue, but sadly, little of the title character.", "images": [], "asin": "B001AH7VZE", "parent_asin": "B001AH7VZE", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1226103849000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}]
