250,3.0,"Doesn't cover the entire screen, does its job of being a reflective surface, however you get what you pay for when it comes to this. Not so crazy cool, but works for now until I decide to buy another one.",B00O2HJNJG,AFO6QN6ICKWUFQV3UEWK5EECIQTQ,0,True

253,3.0,"Wouldn't buy it again, but it's a very sturdy, bulky case. Kickstand is somewhat useful. Case is nice and sharp looking. Wished the front part extended above the screen of my phone, so I wouldn't have to worry about scratches. 3/5.",B00KKRRT0C,AFO6QN6ICKWUFQV3UEWK5EECIQTQ,0,True

267,2.0,"I had one that lasted for about a year. I bought another when that one suddenly stopped working. The second unit quit before I had it for two months. The third unit also quit before the two month mark. This is so handy and nice when it works, but they sure don’t last long. We do not use this excessively. It is usually used to charge two iPads and sometimes a phone overnight. I’d say pass on this unless you are okay spending $50 for two months of use.",B07SBPZ86W,AHXBL3QDWZGJYH7A5CMPFNUPMF7Q,0,True
