work great. use a new one every month,[]
Little on the thin side,[]
"Quick delivery, fixed the issue!",[]
"I wasn't sure whether these were worth it or not, given the cost compared to the original branded filters.<br /><br />I can happily report that these are a great value and work every bit as good as the original. If you are on the fence worrying whether these are worth it- I can assure you they are.",[]
Easy to install got the product expected to receive,[]
After buying this ice machine just 15 months ago and using it 5 times per month it’s now leaking so bad I can’t use it anymore. The company has refused to replace it!,[]
Not the best quality,[]
Part came quickly and fit my LG dryer.  Thanks!,[]
Always arrive in a fast manner.  Descriptions on line are accurate and helpful,[]
The company responded very quickly. Refunded purchase price right away. No problems at all. The unit did not work. I tried ev,[]
Love little kitchen gadgets.  Would recommend this,[]
but i havent had it long  a year down the road  i may change my mind and i love the blue trim  i  didnt realize it matches my  shower curtain so well as its not solid  but pretty swirls of  purples and blues and this matches it nicely  i got the first one and it was broken so i did a return and replace but  im impressed and its quiet and i like tht it has no agitator  for things to get stuck under !!,[]
i have a K15 and was concerned it wouldnt fit  but it was PERFECT !!!,[]
im excited to see how the coffee comes out  i got 2 mason jars too  so i ordered a 2nd one of these so i'll always have 2 in the fridge  for the summer<br /><br />UPDATE:  my first cup was a bit strong  i added way too much coffee i guess but i watered it down with plenty of ice and  half and half - a little cinnamon and vanilla -  i ordered the 2nd filter and it will be here soon and i plan to have iced coffee all summer ...  definitely cutting down on the amount of coffee though !!!!!,[]
what a great deal and it even had a little coffee scooper !!!!!!!!!  i paid this for 1 in Target  when i first got my Keurig last year !!!,[]
worked great,[]
these are OK  a little tooo big  but they work  i had ordered Melita discs and they were so flimsy  !!,[]
thin and chinsy i could even bother returning it i threw them out  - the second they touched the pot it disintegrated,[]
"The filter did not fit in my Keurig K50. When closing the keurig, there was still a small gap that left the keurig slightly open. I had to hold down the keurig in order to get it to register that it was shut and allow me to select my cup size, and still had to hold it down while it was brewing. Then, the water barely flowed through the filter. Tried with a finer grind as described on the instructions. After a minute of holding it there, I had only less than half a cup of coffee. I tried again with a medium grind and still had the same issue. Decided it was not worth my hassle and to return it. Return was easy and was provided with a free return label.",[]
This was hard to find out how to put it into the office maker. I think better instructions would have been nice. I ended up poking a hold in the bottom when I put the lid down. Now coffee grounds come out into my coffee. I would not buy this product again.,[]
"Everything is great, easy to trim to stove and counter design. Thanks",[]
Used in one cup pod machine.  It did the job very well coffee was good.,[]
You can’t beat the price! Awesome stove and looks great!!!,[]
Good price for coffee filters.,[]
"These water filters do the same job as the name brand from Samsung, but they are less expensive.",[]
"I have a percolator of course, but I also have a single cup/kcup maker that has a round at the bottom I used to cut paper towels into circles to catch the drain drips.  Instead, I use a couple of these and change them about 1x a week.  Works really well.   Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

"If you have reusable single cup maker and cup these liners are a must have for easy clean up.  Much easier on the landfill than the plastic cups.  Easy to use and the 'lid' on the top is actually a game changer.  Keeps the grounds exactly where they are suppose to be - in the making cup - NOT your drinking cup.  Love them, feel really comfortable recommending them.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",[]
"I was a little disappointed that it doesn't quite fit in my single cup maker - I had to really slam the top down - eventually I get it in.  Eh. It's like the puncture needle of my maker is a tiny bit off.  I do recommend the cup liners.  It brews a lighter than the commercial single coffee cups in my opinion - but if you have ground coffee - its worth a try just to keep the single use cups out of the garbage.  Just know it doesn't fit ALL single cup makers.  The maker I use is not a national brand.  All of that said, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",[]
I purchased a single cup brewer that has the option of your own coffee... came with a cup to do that - but it is a pain to clean - so I buy these... it's a taller single cup holder so these taller liners are perfect.  I have one cup of coffee a day - and sometimes none at all - so these will last me a good long time.  I like that they are non-bleached - the less chemicals the better in my mind.,[]
"These make using your reusable kcup type cup holder a bit easier to clean and therefore maybe you'll want to use it more often.  :)  I will say that if your reusable shell cup is taller, you should purchase the taller liners.  These work best with the stubbier shells.",[]
"purchased these to go in a single cup maker I just purchased that came with an unusual sized ground coffee filter insert.  The taller paper inserts are a narrower than the cup it's self but are just the right height, works good.  Easy to scoop out the used paper insert - just remember not to overfill.  The shorter paper inserts are a tiny bit wider but not tall enough for this particular reusable filter cup.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, but in this case, I'm pretty sure there will be little else to say... one hopes!",[]
"I actually purchased this to pour one cup of water into my individual cup coffee maker.  So I don't froth milk.. but this pitcher is good for my larger mugs - the other one is smaller mugs - I actually purchased the smaller one first, by accident...Using this pitcher is just easier than guessing how much to pour in.  Overflowing your brewed coffee is such a mess.  They wash in the dishwasher easily - just like your stainless steel utensils.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",[]

Worked ok.  Takes a little practice and easily makes a mess if you don't carefully use per directions.  If you are coordinated you'll be fine.  Turns out my machine wouldn't take the &#34;manual&#34; cup - so I gave the cup and this piece with it away.,[]
"These are ok... I am always looking for ways to make my Keurig more cost effective. These disposable filters are meant to be used with your &#34;use your own coffee&#34; inserts.  They do make it easy to pull out the grounds from your insert, but once they are wet, they edges are hard to grab up. Definitely wait until it has cooled a second or two before grabbing it. Also, it limits the amount of coffee you can actually put in the insert. After you start buying the inserts (plastic, stainless steel..etc), the cups for the inserts, etc...  I keep wondering if I should just go back to buying the Kcups.  It's still a bit cheaper, even with these paper liners so then I guess it comes down to if you want to do the 2 second kcup or spend a minute or two filling your insert.  A personal choice for everyone to make.",[]
"I ordered these after looking into replacements for my coffee maker.  Most are outrageously expensive, so when I found these I was thrilled.  For about the price of a pack of 2 of the brand name filters, I got 12.  I am sure they will work perfectly for my use.  I will update if there are any issues.  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good condition.  I will also note that they are all individually wrapped.  Another bonus.  If you need these kidney shaped water filters for your coffee maker, I would recommend trying these for the price alone.",[]
Does not fit in same hole,[]
Holes do not line up with elements.,"[{'term': 'Holes', 'category': 'NULL', 'opinion': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
perfect part but difficult to install...$160 labor paid,[]
I love these even when using for everyday use protects eggs and safes space in my refrigerator,[]
I ... Love this product! Keeps my eggs save & absolutely secure! Plus I can put cans on top of it.,"[{'term': 'product!', 'category': 'NULL', 'opinion': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'cans', 'category': 'NULL', 'opinion': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Great value and as expected,[]
"I'd love to evaluate this product, but I ordered the wrong size and can't use them in my coffee pot. LOL Oopsie",
Great have purchased before -,
Have purchased several time - totally recommend,
Absolutely great!! Got my ice cubes and water back in refrigerator cause of these !,
This is my second refrigerater with a waterfilter on the bottom and I love it. The water tastes teriffic and you do not need to buy water in the store. I recomment Wirlpool refrigerator hightly with this water filter. This replacement filter is also less money on Amazon.,
Could not install,
Ok,
"Defective product and after speaking to multiple Amazon employees each saying varying things the only way for me to be able to return this is for ME to pay for it to be returned…yeah they want me to pay to return a defective product. So in the end I wouldn’t only be out the humidifier I wanted I’d be out the cost of the humidifier and the cost of sending it back so I wouldn’t even get the money I spent originally back in full. I’ve never paid return fees before, especially not for a defective product. Amazon has gone increasingly down hill very fast this last year and I honestly am done with Amazon at this point which is quite disappointing considering I’m disabled and Amazon was my main source of products for myself, my family and pets.",
"These are great, especially when cooking items that overflow the pot , like soup. When a spill occurs, you simply put the burner in the sink to soak. Minimal mess left on stove. After it soaks and you wash off the grime, simply place it back on stove burner. The items are thin, so do not clean completely and evertualy need to be thrown out due to wear. But they make cleaning the stove much easier and are just pennies  each.",
these work great and were as described and fast shipment. happy,
"Great, just what I was expecting. I've washed them once and they held up very well and they look nice.",
"Arrived quickly, installed and working great..",
If you love pellet ice then this is the unit for you.  I put this in my bar and use it almost every day.  It does put out some heat and is a little loud when it is making ice but I absolutely love it!,
Love it but can’t replace because of company is out of business so I brought different one and good so far,
Family love it and use for cold drinks !!,
These were easy to insert around the drum of our dryer.  They stopped the loud screeching noise that was coming from our dryer since the old ones were away.  They been working great for over a month now!  They were half the price with free prime shipping vs the online parts store!,
Easy to install. Use for a GE refrigerator.,
I am not sure what type of Keurig I have but this works great in it!  It sits up high enough so it does not get punctured like a regular k-cup does.  I would recommend this product.  Works great and easy to clean.  Like that the bottom is screen like the sides.,
"These are ok,  it i prefer the brand name",
"This is small enough to fit in most refrigerators.  It has a small foot print and is not that tall either.  Amazingly does hold 30 eggs.  If you buy and use a lot of eggs, this is ideal.",
Looks like new!!!,
Absolutely adorable!,
"I’m not going to leave one star because of my error. the product does seem durable, it was a great deal and shipped fast. I have the K475 which isn’t stated in the description, however I thought it may work regardless. It didn’t.<br />I’m leaving my review for others with the same machine to know this model won’t work.",
They are a good replacement for the stove.,
"This has been an absolute lifesaver in a very small refrigerator; I am able to store and entire carton of eggs in a small space, and better yet, can stack other items on top of them without worrying about crushing or breaking them. Sturdy plastic construction and super easy to clean with a quick wipe down.",
Fits,
This filter will not work in most percolators. The problem is that the filter is a smaller diameter than the basket and it sticks up too high so that you cannot put the lid back on the basket. The basket lid would also make a lot of the water go outside of the filter instead of into it.,
Helps keep my kitchen clean,
Got the dryer working again!,
"With 2 containers you can store 28 eggs.  These wash easily, but not in the dishwasher.  The bottom is ok, but the top warped.",
"This is great for a stove that has raised burners.  It gives extra counter space when only using two burners on the stove.  Great for small kitchen spaces.  Love the bamboo.  It's lightweight, durable and easy to clean.",
Perfect replacement part for my dryer.,
"I have always been annoyed with the dripping of the refrigerator water dispenser. I am frequently having to clean the white mineral stains. This is a great idea! It doesn't quite fit my refrigerator, but it does cover the area where the drips usually land. The width is nearly perfect. It's just not as deep as the area. There are 4 pads which is more than I need. I think 2 would be enough so I could have one under the water hose and one in the laundry.",
"My elderly father was recently in rehab for a few weeks. While he was there, both pairs of his pajama pants disappeared. He told the staff and a few days later he received 2 new pairs of pajama pants, but they weren't as soft and comfortable as his old, missing ones. Now he's back in his assisted living center and I plan to label all of his clothes. He hasn't had any problems at his place, but it's better to be prepared. These labels are pretty small. The whole package is pretty small and I almost missed it. It came in a box with other items so I didn't notice it at first. I tested it out on a couple of pieces of my own clothing. I used both a regular ball point pen on one and a fine tip Sharpie on the other. I was impressed that neither of them smeared, even after touching the ink right after writing on it. I affixed the stickers to the labels of the clothing items. After being laundered, they looked practically the same. These are great!! Perfect for kids at daycare, camp, and the elderly!",
"This egg storage rack holds a lot of eggs. One rack holds 18 eggs. The spacing of the shelves in my refrigerator only fit one rack, so I am not using both of them right now. I have been putting the older eggs in the front and the newer ones in the back so we're using the older ones first. At first, the eggs weren't rolling forward when one was removed. We discovered that the rack was on the lip/edge of the shelf so we pushed it back a little and then the eggs were able to roll into position as ones were taken out.",
"I am very impressed with this herb keeper. It works really well! It is large, so I had to rearrange some things in my refrigerator to find a spot for it, but it's worth it. I often by fresh herbs and I always end up having to throw them away because they've gone bad. I am very pleased with this gadget!",
"There are times when the ice maker on the refrigerator can't keep up with our ice needs. Usually that's when we're entertaining or going out and taking the cooler somewhere. This counter top ice maker will hopefully make life easier. We set this up and followed the directions. It didn't take long before we started making ice. It is a slow process. It took about 2 hours to fill the ice basket. This isn't something you can just start doing to get a lot of ice right away. However, if you plan in advance, it should be fine. We will start making ice the night before it's needed then bag it up and put it in the freezer. I love that this maker recycles the melted water. That's a great idea! While it is noisy, it's more of a white noise than anything else. We found it to not be distracting. We like the shapes of the ice cubes. My husband thought it would be nice if the front of the maker was see through so you could see how much ice you have without having to peer down into it. Overall, this works well and makes decent ice cubes.",
"These door handle covers are quite festive. It comes with a pair - Santa and Mrs. Clause. They don't fasten tight enough to keep them where I want (the middle of the handles) and instead they fall to the bottom no matter what I do! They still look cute, but it's not exactly what I wanted. The stickers, however, are awesome! I have been putting them on the backs of my Christmas card envelopes.",
"I love having a refrigerator just for beer! We have half size refrigerator for drinks, but that gets full pretty quickly with water bottles, sodas, and juice. Now we can put the beer and malt beverages in this refrigerator and keep the rest of the drinks in the old one. The glass shelves are very sturdy and easy to rearrange. The older half size refrigerator has plastic shelves and when you put a lot of weight on the shelves, it has shown signs of cracking and bowing. Not the case with this refrig. I have filled it with a mix of beer and sparkling tall/slim cans. I might be able to get a couple more cans in there, but I think it's pretty close to capacity. It's easy to adjust the temperature with the digital display. It's doing a great job of keeping our adult beverages nice and cold.",
"Over the years I have developed my own morning time routine and coffee is a part of it. I have GERD so my GI specialist wants me to limit caffeine. I try to keep it at 1 cup every morning. This half-caff allows me to have a second cup! It tastes good, although I do had my flavored sugar free creamer to it, so I'm not drinking it black. The k-cups work well in my Keurig. This box has 100 k-cups, so that should last me a while.",
This small stainless steel frothing jug is an excellent quality. It's sturdy. It's the perfect size for frothing milk for your coffee beverages. It's easy to clean and care for. I am very pleased with it.,
"I am very happy to have found these! My husband and I have an Esperta2 machine. I've been happy with the prefilled pods that are available, but my husband prefers his whole bean coffee. This allows him the convenience of using the Esperta with his own coffee. These work well in our machine. You do have to make sure you line up the little hole correctly when you insert it into the machine. The directions explain how fine or coarse the coffee needs to be for using it. It comes with a spoon and brush. We used to have a Tassimo machine and there were not any reusuable pods that worked with it, so I am pleased that we found these. I'm excited to be able to use some nice flavored coffee beans. I love that these cut down on trash, too! **Update 5/21/2017 - I am still using these and still like them. However, I did want to add something to my review. They don't come out of the pod holder very easily. I usually have to turn the holder upside down and tap it slightly to get it to come out. When doing that, that sometimes dislodges the little filter screen. I didn't realize that it had come out one time and I threw it in the trash with the coffee grounds. Now that I know that can happen, I make sure that it's still there. And if it has come dislodged, I make sure to find it before I throw out the grounds. It's easy to put back in - it just snaps in place. I didn't realize it was even missing until I made coffee the next time with that pod and my coffee was full of grounds! Just wanted to share that.",
First machine lasted 6 months. Was replaced under warranty and that machine lasted about 7 months. The ice is great but who wants a $500 machine that doesn’t even last 6 months. Highly disappointed!,
I will buy these again for sure,
Anyone with a Bunn coffee maker know you need real Bunn filter because they are taller. These are cheaper and just as good.,
My local appliance shop wanted $45.20 for this part. This works just as well as his part would have and both parts were Not OEM,
"It arrived today, well packaged, and I've used it once.  Very pleased with this compact, quiet dryer !",
"Love the convenience of doing laundry inside my apartment, but do have a problem attaching the drain pipe when ready to drain the tub.  Trial and error, I'm getting there.  I have done several loads and am pleased with this machine overall.",
"1.  The exhaust ""hose"" is ridiculous -- hard plastic, totally unusable; had to purchase a regular flexible kit at the hardware store.<br /><br />2.  UPDATE MARCH 2013 --  Initial review in parens (Major complaint is the lint filter.  First time cleaning was no problem, it popped right back into place.  Second time - no such luck, it refuses to pop back in place -- very frustrating.  The two loads I was able to dry came out just fine, but without that lint filter in place, it's now just a dust collector !)  Problem solved; just make sure you pay attention when replacing the filter sections, I had mine reversed, thus it would not ""connect""!  Thanks to a patient customer service rep for sending me photos, I finally noticed I had the thing reversed.  Dryer is back in working order and I am loving it !!!",
It does not fit the Haier WD-2800-25,
Fast and easy,
"I like the ice cube shapes,takes a while to make.I make them then store them in a zip lock and put them in the freezer.",
Works,
We have had this product for a while and the water taste is great. I think it is good to rinse all filters before the first use to get best results.,
I work in a bookstore and so these little gadgets are great for keeping an eye on humidity and temperature. Really clear and easy to read screens and when tested against other devices these have come out to be the most accurate. Great little devices and very discreet looking if you don’t want a big ugly reader on the wall. Highly recommend.,
This washes clothes just as good as any washing machine. Only issues I have is it has the smallest drain hose and takes forever to drain. The spin cycle is a joke. Don’t buy it for the spin cycle it doesn’t help drying at all. Just a waste of time. I live in a dry area so this wasn’t very important for me. The basket is small and worthless. I just removed the basket and the clothes still agitate just fine.  It is much better than having to make stops just to do laundry while in the RV.,
"Very easy to use! Made sealing cookies a breeze! Just an FYI, I used treat bags from Hobby Lobby on the level two setting and followed the directions on the side of the sealer.",
"It is definitely not a watercolor book.  The paper bucked completely.  The pages honestly appear to be photo copies of other pictures. I say that bc if you look at the seal pics you can see the tell tale line at the bottom of the page.  As someone who has made many photocopies of pages in my time so I could try out different colors & mediums that black line is a dead giveaway to me. It’s on other pages too.  The entire book just seems off. Nothing is sharp & clear. There is what looks like toner dust on all the pages making them look muddy.  There are no sharp lines & there is no clear definition.  At least there isn’t in my copy.  And the Coloring Book for Adult on the bottom of the front cover annoys me. Why is it singular & not plural?  They usually say coloring book for kids or coloring book for kids & adults or coloring book for adults- plural.  Lol  Plus it would work for kids if you can get over the grey scale nature of it.  Personally I’m not going to waste expensive pens & paints trying to paint over the grey & black mess.  I grew up in SW Florida minutes from the beaches & I was really excited about the sea life in this. I hope the printers & designers figure out how to clean up the mess bc some of the designs are really cute. They just aren’t worth my time to hand trace & transfer them, but I’m sure there are ppl that will be up to the challenge.  This is one is a hard no. Going back. I tried.",
Updated: after first book arrived very damaged the replacement arrived in perfect condition.,
"I bought it for the bag on the front so it paid for itself with that imo.  I haven’t started anything yet from it bc I’m still busy with other projects, but I’m really looking forward to starting some.",
Updated: after 1st arrived damaged the replacement arrived in perfect condition.,
"I love this book!  The patterns are lovely. I admit I’m not even following all of them to the letter. I am more of a free spirit.  I see the designs & take a look at the dimensions & just kind of wing it from there sometimes. lol. I’m 54 now & much less rigid in my arts & crafts than I was in my younger days when I would go to 6 stores trying to find the right threads or yarns. Lol. Those days are over!  Praise the Lord!  It’s a lot more fun now too.  As Bob Ross used to say- “Happy Mistakes!”  I make a lot of them sometimes, but I have found that the journey for me is a lot more interesting these days. Lol.",
Missing the sketch pad. Even worse I realized it’s identical to the Drawing Lab For Mixed Media Artists book I already bought.,
"Seriously one of only a few books they I have ordered from Amazon that has arrived in pristine condition. No bent edges, no buckled covers, no marred printing, no mysterious liquids, & no folded pages. The book is lovely, but my continued pet peeve with books like this is the manufacturer’s insistence of printing on both sides of the damned pages. So you can’t frame one picture without losing the image on the other side. It’s annoying.  I’d gladly pay more for a book with printed images on only one side & on watercolor grade papers.  So instead I guess I will be yanking these out, scanning them, & printing them on my own watercolor papers so that I can use the images on both sides.  The paper just does not hold up to a lot of media of you choose to use both sides in my experience. Ever.  I believe I now own all, but one of JD books & I will be buying it for myself for Mother’s Day. Lol. I love her art. I love her stamps. I love this book, but I’m knocking a star bc printing on both sides is stupid imo when the book is meant to be used to create more art.  Why limit the artists by making us choose which side to use for framing or which side to use if we choose to cut one side up & decoupage it onto something. We are then paying double for half a book!  It’s insane imo. Give the buyers options other than creating more work like I mentioned with the breaking the book apart & scanning it for personal use & printing it on better papers.",
"I love this book.  I was not blessed with artistic talent. Music yes. Drawing no. Lol. I have several of her books now & I fully intend to buy more for myself, my 5 kids, & my grandkids. We all love arts & crafts & these books are just awesome. My only issue is I haven’t brought myself to work in them yet! Lol. I use a separate sketch book!  I’m old school. Taught never to write in books or deface them. The only time I do is if the grammar or punctuation is wrong or the idiot author has now said the killer has blue eyes where previously they said green. Plot errors drive me crazy. Those times I will fix the mistakes. Lol.  So I’m hoping to bring myself to actually work & draw in the books. Lol.  I’m hoping she makes a lot more of them.",
"I really wanted to like this book bc I have her other two books, but someone got greedy. It’s half the size, but the same price.  I expected all jungle animals so finding papayas, figs, coconuts, & pineapples seems like another cop out. If I wanted a fruit book I’d have bought one!  These pages appear thinner too. You can see the images from the artwork on the other sides bleed through. I love the artist & her work, but I’m very disappointed with this book. It’s a measly 64 pages & 4 of the projects (the fruit) I will never paint in my lifetime.  There are so many animals she could have put in here like zebras, lions, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, alligators, crocodiles, & ostriches etc instead of the stupid fruit.  Poorly executed in book content & length, but lovely artwork on the good ones.  Not worth $23 ever imo.  I gave it 3 stars bc it’s not worth the price since it’s half the book of her previous ones & the content is lacking for art projects.",
Every page has a crease running the entire length of the book about an inch and a half from the edges.,
"This was my 6th copy!  All 5 of my kids had their own copy. While FaceTime reading with my granddaughter who lives in Tennessee while I live in Colorado she was complaining that her little sister wrote in her favorite book and she opened it to the front to show me.  I burst out laughing because it was actually my youngest son’s (now 17!) book from when he was a kid. He had scrawled Joseph on the front inside cover (nearly illegible as he was 4! and only a mom would recognize it!) and Sophia was irritated thinking her little sister was disrespecting her books.  Turns out my daughter had raised my storage container looking for her Nancy Drew books, but came across Joseph’s box!  I immediately bought Sophia her own!",
Can't wait to try these patterns!,
Her books are great and I love making the animals!,
"If you're looking for a comprehensive resource for NCLEX prep, look no further...this book is fantastic. Extensive topic coverage complete with rationales for every response. Prefer going online to take quizzes? No problem this book's got that, too. (Although the content online is a tad bit confusing to navigate, once you figure out how to get to the quizzes section, you won't forget.) I have several books for review and this one is my personal favorite. Some of my professors loan this text out to students, but I prefer 24/7 availability in my own home! :-) Happy studying, future nurses!<br /><br />UPDATE: I saw sooo many reviewers having trouble getting to the online content to take system-specific quizzes that I decided to post instructions here on how to get to the right place.<br /><br />1) Go to the Pearson Pegasus log-in page once you've set up online access, and log in.<br />2) Click on the book title on the left side of the website.<br />3) On the next page, on the left side near the top, you will see a menu bar that has the following options: ""Today's View, Course Content, Grades, Communicate"". Look just BELOW this menu bar and you will see the following options: ""View All Content, Course Calendar, Learning Objectives.""<br />4) Click on Learning Objectives.<br />5) On the left side, you will see the following options: ""Client Need, Topics Areas, Integrated Process.""<br />6) To take quizzes related to your system or topic of choice, click the plus sign for ""Topics Areas"".<br />7) Click on your system of choice.<br />8) On the right side, there are several options for that topic of study. Scroll down to the bottom-ish. You will see a heading called ""Self Study"" for that topic of study. Click on it.<br />9) A separate pop-up window will appear so that you may begin your quiz.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to comment below. Note that the online quiz portion only works with Internet Explorer and certain versions of Firefox, but not with Chrome.",
Wonderful book but not crazy about using the word hate with the kids...too strong a word for the fun topic. We just read it and choose a different word to use in its place,
We love this book and the FOUND book also by Salina Yoon.,
I waned to like it but its just...  meh... not using it in my nursing. Have found better items. Will donate,
Sweet bookplates!,
"Cute book! Not quite as good as the original but still a fun one to read at Christmastime, my kids enjoyed it.",
"I bought two packs of postcards- thinking 60 would be plenty, but I have to tell you everyone that has seen them has asked if I have more?? They are all different book covers, so the variety is nice! Works as a cute gift too! Highly recommended.",
I bought these and the Nancy Drew postcards(also listed here on Amazon). My daughter wanted a ND party for her birthday and these work great as simple thank you cards! Super cute and sweet for anyone of any age! I am buying more just to have on hand. Highly recommended.,
"Only read and believe things you want to see come true. Focus your attention on stories that uplift and inspire a greater future. The author meant well, but has his own journey and beliefs to conquer to see clearly.",
I've been listening to Brian and Jenn's music for 13 years.  They've always been such an encouragement.  It meant a lot for someone in this position to write his story honestly.  For some reason I think that you need to be perfect for God to use you.  And I fear what people will think if I talk about hard things I'm going through.  Thank you Brian for taking the risk.,
I love the continuing story of My Travel Friends and the beautiful illustrations! There are 37 pages and the print is clear and easy to read! I love the discussion questions on the last page. The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs! We will read the whole series. My family loves these books!,
My kids and I love this book. It is colorful and has a good story. There are 39 pages and the print is clear and easy to read! This is the 1st book in a series of 7. The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs! My kids are learning to do the right thing and make good choices! We will read the whole series. Love it!,
A well thought out book that teaches my kids manners and how to be polite!!! Could it get any better?!? There are 30 beautiful designed and illustrated pages in the continuing story of My Travel Friends. This series just gets better and better! The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs!,
The colorful pages and decorative text is fun to look at and beautifully created. The My Travel Friends Series are wonderful books that my whole family love. There are 37 gorgeous pages and beautiful illustrations! Recycling and keeping our water clean is a story I love to read to my kids. The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs!,
yep.  need this.,
challenging and good,
"The bible talks about praying for people who hurt you.  Jason's story is so real, so hard.  But he takes the high road.  Like Christ, he forgave.  He is living the happy life now because he chose to forgive.<br /><br />Legitimate read.",
Ordered this book for my father in law for Christmas & the shipping was FAST. Item arrived as expected. Can't wait to give it to him.,
Got this book for my son who was graduating 5th grade & had his teacher's all sign it.,
"This is such a sweet and thoughtful story. No child should ever feel they aren’t special, unique and loved. Simeon is for anyone, really. There is a beautiful message in this book and the illustrations are so organic and imperfect that any child can relate to them. Just buy it. It’s worth it",
I love it.,
I love it.,
Love it.,
"Much too big for the &#34;pocket&#34; address book I was looking for. Has more categories than I needed for each person, therefore leaving little squinty areas for name phone and address. Although double the size of the one I'm trying to replace...less space for the basic's. Nicely made but not what I needed.",
"This is a great start to a world filled with religion, politics and war. Justir is presented in a way that I feel allowed me to really understand him. The environment is fleshed out and I could imagine the surroundings while reading. Also, the era of the book isn't mentioned, but I feel as if I know that too.<br /><br />Personally, I felt connected to the story early on. If I had to make criticism I would point to the story sometimes moving too fast for me. As if I was barely keeping up with Justir. Also, there are a few typos that you will notice, but they don't detract from the story telling.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone who likes to read fantasy/has an interest in how multiple facets like war, politics and religion play together.",
Simple message and little writing but so cute and a fun twist at the end! Love it for my littles!,
My little one just likes doctors so I thought this book would be fun but it’s not what I expected. It’s more about helping if your little one is scared of going to the doctor. There is only one picture of the doctor in the book.,
Cute!,
Well I was trying to help mother in law out with her no salt low sodium diet. I am not sure she got any help from this book. I believe she is looking for something simpler. I am not saying it didn't help her at all and it's not a great book but I got this as a gift to help her. I should have done some reading through it first!,
The imagery in this book is so good that I actually slept with my light on a few times. I chose this book because I'm a fan of horror in general and the exorcist is one of my all time favorites. I didn't have high expectations of this book because the subjects been over done but this book reeled me in from the very beginning.,
I've seen all the Hell Raiser movies but some how I never that movies where novels! I just so happened to come across this book and man oh man! It didn't disappoint. This is one of the few novels I've actually finished and I can't wait to start the next one.,
This is an amazing book that makes me look at my house differently now!,
This is an adorable story with an African American Cajun Hero. Her concoctions might be vile but her heart is pure. My kids and I absolutely love this book. We can't stop saying Gitchey Gone lol! Great for teaching repetition and helping kids deal with scary themes. Highly recommend.,
Nothing new for a collector of Antique Jewellery!  Pretty much all the pieces on this book have been in other Jewelry books!!!  And the funny/annoying thing no prices of the auction prices are listed either.<br /><br />Sad to say I was really disappointed with it.  Buy a used copy if you really want it!,
Loved this book....as a financial advisor  I loved the link to jewels  as currency  and the history. I  wish it had  pictures of shiny objects!,
I laughed and cried. Sad that the industry has a lot of truth in this book.  However made me happy it is not just me. Well written...thank you!,
"My first read with this author.  The story line was interesting, great character development.  The chapters are short and weave in and out the story as it touches the lives of characters.  While getting close to the end, I put the book down for a week because I didn't want the book to end - it kept me hooked.  I don't do that with books, leave it alone to take small bites but this one I did.  The author herself is interesting; she is a journalist and served as a BBC news presenter.  Story telling is her way to decompress from the crimes she reported and reports on which I find truly remarkable and commendable.  She's a great author, contributor and story telling artist. Thanks Teresa Driscoll.",
"This is one of a series of books, very interesting and uses one's imagination well.  Love the old photo's that are weaved into the story.",
Interesting read and the old photographs add to the story.  Loved it so much I purchased the next two stories so I could continue the journey,
Just what I was looking for.  Thank you.,
"Purchased this item as a gift for my friend, was well received.  The product is of good quality and lots of pictures!",
Minimal use marks and still in great usable condition.,
Great condition and even had a note of encouragement!,
"I was locked in within the first chapter! As a 75 year old woman living with a husband who lives for Sci-Fi, I chose this book only  after reading excellent reviews--yet with a bit of skepticism.<br />Wondering how this writer could do Sci-Fi differently with all that's out there, I wanted to see if I would recommend it to my husband--especially since it seemed to be targeted for young adults.<br />It was an immediate page turner! Such an unusual & exciting journey, it had me sitting on the edge of my seat.  I truly hope it will become a movie! My husband has already started it.  And I can't wait for the next book to be available!!!  Write ON dear author!",
Every single recipe is WONDERFUL!!,
"At 74 years of age the title of this book made me look twice.  What a wonderful surprise inside. It is filled with hope, understanding and truth--something we all can use a little more of at this time. I definitely can relate to it and can see why young women will love it too!  I plan to take mine to our women's Bible study this Thurs to share with my study group. I'm hopeful that the author will continue writing similar devotionals for other books in the Bible. This book is a pleasure to pick up for a brief moment on the run or to sit back and enjoy with a cup of coffee in a comfy chair.<br />Yes! I highly recommend it to all women! More please...",
Enjoyed the story and exposure to the country's people and culture. No matter the area the ugliness of human nature always rests it's hard and we need warriors to stand in the gap till Jesus comes.,
Need to pay attention to what is happening in the world today!,
good read.,
Looking forward to reading it!,
Loved it,
very happy!,
he's telling the truth about a situation that has been saying bag by the environment with radicals for yearslet me repeat this this is something that has been saying bag by the environmental radicals for years another words it's a lie but he's telling the truth,
A classic book that everyone needs in their collection.,
This book is beautifully written and easy to read. Matthew Perry is more than just the funny guy. He struggles with never feeling like he is enough. What a roller coaster to read. I hope he is doing well and lives the rest of his days in happiness.,
"The name of the book implies a good fantasy story. While there is a unicorn in the book and a wizard…I found the book extremely boring. I rarely do not finish a book, but I did not finish this one.",
I kept reading thinking the good part must be coming with all the good reviews this book got. The good part never comes. This book is a pointless read in my opinion. Then halfway through the book it turns into a book of short stories. The short stories are not good either. Buy a better book.,
This is not what I thought it was. All of the questions are way too close together - the book is not meant to be written in. I wanted a book my loved ones could fill out the answers to the questions in. This is just a huge list of questions. Way more questions than anyone would ever want to answer.,
This book took me a few chapters to get into it- so don’t give up! Once I was into the story it was a great read. Very different and unexpected. I hate predictable same old story books,
This is my daughters favorite thing ever. Much cheaper than buying all the little figurines too,
Love it! So cute and definitely keeps my little one busy :).,
My two year old sat on my lap and demanded I read the entire book. It's a good buy :),
Love love love this book,
Very small lines to color had to get 4.0 markers. But the size is perfection,
"Really an adult coloring book, very challenging, that’s what I was looking for,",
Not for adults at all,
"Enjoy watercolor painting alot,  this helped make it easy,  wasnt prepared for the size of the tracings they are all very large,  would have liked a selection of sizes",
"Was a gift, she loved it",
I got the book but cd is missing! !!,
I am sad because Twitch died before his time…,
Expensive but cute....,
"Baby loves this book! He’s 11 months and loves to find the animals, eat the pages, carry it all around the house, and show it off",
"This book is dumb, maybe worth $0.50 certainly not $2.00 you could easily find this in a dollar store and prob even better, there are 4 cupcake pictures and a few stickers.. not sure what I was expecting but this was definitely a disappointment",
"Book was in great condition and shipping was fast. Good, honest seller.",
Great book. Love the colors on the page when a picture is done. Very relaxing.,
Probably one of my favorite Uncle John's bathroom readers. Lots of interesting facts I never knew about PA and I've lived here all my life. Flew through this book....didn't want to put it down.,
Always a good read.,
Lovin this TV edition of the Bathroom Reader. I can remember so many of the articles since I lived through them.,
Love all the Uncle John's Bathroom Readers but I especially like this one.,
Another great pop-up book by David Carter.,
"Love these pop- up books, but I do have to supervise the little ones with them.",
What a cute pop-up book. Well made too. I had as much fun looking at it as my grandchildren will have. Already have plans to get the Snow Bugs one.,
My 1 year old granddaughter had a ball with this book. Cute!,
"All my grandkids ( ages 3, 2 and 1) just love the Bizzy bear books. We have 3 and will be getting more.",
Its an ok book.,
Cute book. Got it for my 3 year old Granddaughter for Christmas. I think she will love it.,
Just a ok book at best. Needs a different ending for sure.,
I bought this bc I thought it had the nice white background. Turns out it’s clear & since my phone is blue it doesn’t look anything like this.  If I had known that I would have purchased something else. It works ok.,
Perfect. How pissed am I that I recently paid $20 for 1 Fitbit cable and promptly lost the damned thing?  Extremely pissed!  I keep the spare in my medicine bag so hopefully I won’t lose it and my grandson can’t get to it and try to use it as a belt or a dog leash or any of the other nutty things he’s been using the other one for.,
Overall very happy with the end result. If you hate puzzles don’t do it. I love puzzles and it worked for me. Took a lot of concentration and attention to detail and about an hour! The YouTube video helped a ton with installing the new screen. Highly recommend using a how to video when replacing your screen. The tools and supplies they provided were adequate. I did use additional tools from my home to successfully installed a new screen. My screws on the inside of the iPhone were stuck and I had to use an X-Acto knife to get them to come out. The glass Screen for the iPhone was beautiful and worked great. The screen protector that was additional came cracked (Not a big deal as it was extra in my eyes). I did need to use the X-Acto knife to cut off part of a plastic piece to make the final fit. So yes I modified the screen and instructions but ended up working great for me.<br /><br />I was very careful with all of the circuit boards and connections as recommended on the YouTube video. My screen replacement was very successful and I’m very happy with how it turned out.,
Lasted about 9 months then the lock button broke off. Decent product but costing scrapes off like crazy.  I shredded this case. Protected my phone tho,
LOVE THIS CASE! Works better than my expensive $35 cases! lol,
This item works great with my IPhone 13 with Magna Case on it. Also charges my Apple watch & IPods all at the same time. No issues at all. Fast shipping was great! On of the best chargers I have owned.,
Item came as described! Fast shipping & east to install!,
Stocking stuffers for my boys & they liked them.,
My son loves his camo case! It is a great value & protects the phone from the normal wear & tear of a pre teen!,
"These work. It is a little difficult to get the yellow side off the sticky but, otherwise a great product!",
These really work! I like having one in my bathroom near the medicine cabinet when I'm getting ready for work and one on the wall by my desk connected to the charger. This way I don't lose it or get water on it.,
These big phones are so hard for me to hang onto in my little hand. This case with a popsocket is the best!,
"Works great, looks great, sticks, great!",
"Some people have given this less favorable reviews. My feeling is that for the price, It's VERY good. It's grippy, it fits well, the portals are unobstructed and it's slim. Not bulky at all. I wish they had more colors because, for the price, I would have several. My popsocket sticks to it too!",
Great fit and love the color. Just enough grip and non-skid in the car. The charger is a little bit annoying to plug in because the bottom tend to overlap a tiny bit so you have to plug in at an angle...but it works fine.,
It's hard to separate the ring from the inner circle..it's hard to grab. It does at least rotate. Now laying your phone flat is not an option though.,
"Putting it on a night stand drawer or top of headboard.  Just don't try to tighten it up to where it doesn't slip off.  When the husband tightened his up it popped off and cracked the head on the base.  Hope they stand behind the product, we will see?",
We've survived a few drops. Nice case.,
"I got these for my wife and she loves them. They fit her really well and sound pretty good. I wouldn't compare them to something like bose qc 35 or sony's flagship, but rather to offerings from mpow,anker,aukey etc. I think they perform just as good as the 60-80 dollar competitors.",
"Went on perfect. Clean phone with wet wipe, then dry wipe. then microfiber and dust pickup stickers. Pull the tab off and lay the glass screen on the phone. It should go on with the bubbles escaping by itself. Took ten minutes and I have no bubbles or dust under the screen from what I can see.",
"Fits and stays in vent while holding a moto x with an otter box. The magnet is still very strong through the case. For the price, it's hard to beat and I would recommend to anyone who can spare to lose an air vent.",
Better than the straight original because wire doesn't break when used a lot in portrait alignment.,
It was perfect,
Fast charging,
Great band. Fits perfectly and adjustable.,
Works great!,
"Great case. Stylish, durable and not bulky.",
A bit complicated to apply. Requires spraying adhesive on a cloth in order to apply to watch face. Instructs you to wait a few days before all the air bubbles dry. Did not want to put something so permanent on my new Apple watch.,
"Adorable, and good quality. the service was on time and easy.",
"Yep, this is what I expected",
"This product is cheaply made, some of the parts are missing, and the directions do not help at all. The product is not as represented both in the description and what I received is nothing like what i see in many of the customer photos. It would cost me more to return this than I paid for it, so in the trash it's going.",
"This product works perfectly and the price is amazing. I already ordered a second one so I can have one in the living room and one on my nightstand in my bedroom. Great product, works as advertised.",
It was ok wasn't what I wanted. Endy up ordering a different  one.,
It was a gift.  She liked it.,
My sister love it butter then any I have give her.,
"I absolutely do not like this phone. Screen is small and phone is slow, laggy and won't charge while plugged in. I knew this was not an expensive phone but I didn't think it would be this bad.",
Nice phone with decent sized screen. Charges fast. You can also use a simple mobile sim card in this phone. Good phone for people who don't enjoy frills and thrills,
Wrks great to power up my Kindle Fire.  Great price and arrived quickly.,
perfect for what I needed does take some moving around to getting it charged with case on,
Love this.....it's amazing and haven't lost any gems.  When others see it they want it!  So I tell them where to buy it!!!!,
"I purchased this as a gift, she loved it.  Especially the hat on the yoga kitty.  It is very cute and useful too.",
"Refurbished so I expected it to work well but it gives me trouble on and off.  Trouble in terms of dropping out going calls, many times it won't send my text messages and there are times I have learned of missed calls coming in which isn't good when you use this as your only phone.  I realize I saved some money on getting the refurbished model to replace my original but am now thinking I have to spend the money to get something that would be really reliable on a consistent basis.  I don't blame the folks who refurbished it because it probably worked for them when testing it out.",
Very nice to use.  In fact I only bought one and will need to purchase more because my family fights over it....which is nice.  Just wish it came in a better assortment of colors.,
"I like this virgin phone, it's held up very well and is easy to use.  It's hard to find much variety in the virgin phones anymore that don't have some form of contract so that's the only downside.",
awesome bracket! really am pleased!,
WRONG CABLE. . .DID NOT USE. . .,
It works great!!!!,
"Quick delivery, outstanding quality and looks fantastic!!",
I didn’t like this product because water got inside.,
"Broke the first day I got it, but I liked it.",
"Doesn't cover the entire screen, does its job of being a reflective surface, however you get what you pay for when it comes to this. Not so crazy cool, but works for now until I decide to buy another one.",
"You get what you pay for, not for protective wear in the slightest but still a cool parlor trick.",
"Got it in the mail and was way too excited to use it, I usually only get 10% charged on my phone and the thing is done.",
"Wouldn't buy it again, but it's a very sturdy, bulky case. Kickstand is somewhat useful. Case is nice and sharp looking. Wished the front part extended above the screen of my phone, so I wouldn't have to worry about scratches. 3/5.",
I like the design & the weight of the case feels comfortable,
Fell apart right away.  Clamps get in the way of the buttons on iPhone 5,
Have bought this brand for a few years. I have had my current one on for 2 years. Bought these for my husband’s upgrade,
"Within 2 weeks of using it fell off the phone at some point and now is lost, forever I suppose. I like the way it felt while using for holding phone and loved how it worked as a stand but magnet did not hold sadly.",
The pictures aren’t clear,
"Ok, it's attractive and I liked that it had slots for credit cards.  But it doesn't actually hold your phone in place.  Which, by definition, is what a case is for.",
Stopped working pretty quickly.,
Durable.  Just what I needed.,
Too slippery.  I dropped my phone constantly.  Had too get something different.,
Unique & pretty. Nice sizing abilities with the chain.,
"Very diverse. Bought as gifts, they liked them. Some use at desk, some are using in their cars.",
I like what it do fast in do the Job!!  I got my friends  buying it  how it sits and charge  without  plugging it in. You have to check it out!,
Really nothing I don't have to charge in a couple of days last that law such energy such power I should this a long time ago,
"I had one that lasted for about a year. I bought another when that one suddenly stopped working. The second unit quit before I had it for two months. The third unit also quit before the two month mark. This is so handy and nice when it works, but they sure don’t last long. We do not use this excessively. It is usually used to charge two iPads and sometimes a phone overnight. I’d say pass on this unless you are okay spending $50 for two months of use.",
Arrived broken and is the wrong size even though it clearly says it will fit the phone. I would not recommend this.,
Bought this for my son for his birthday. He loves it!,
awful case for protection. Very pretty to look at but would not suggest,
Great case,
Great replacement for a wallet. The phone case itself is removable from the base of the wallet. The magnetic hold of the phone is strong and sturdy,
Crap,
"As long as you follow the directions EXACTLY, it’s easy to apply",
"The screen protector is complicated to put on, but if you follow the instructions EXACTLY it is easy and works perfectly. Just don’t skip any steps or jump ahead, thinking you know what to do. Just read it and follow the directions in order",
"Great system for application.  It actually went on easy, straight and with NO BUBBLES.  JETech perfected this system.",
"I bought a renewed  iPhone 8 and OMG it is beautiful.  The only way anyone could know that it was reconditioned was by the white box it came in.  No scratches,  dents, cracks or any  imperfections.  I did upgrade to Excellent condition, but I never thought it would be so nice.  THANK YOU!!!!!",
Beautiful & functional,
The bendable arm is extra sturdy & the clips that hold the phone in place seem to be strong & easy to use,
This case is terrible. It looks terrible because it is see through it is all nearly IMPOSSIBLE to take the case off. Please do not buy.,
Ordered for husband he likes to carry all his cards and money instead of ell and wallet. Works good. Looks like a woman's wallet but he likes it I like teasing him. Good quality product,
This cover for my phone and seems to stay in place with no issues.,
"This product did not fit my smart watch, returned, no problems returned money fast.",
"These bands did not fit my fitness watch but I so wished they could have, they were super nice , soft and great colors. Returned. Fast and convenient returns!",
All was good worked as expected,
"Purchased for my husband, he loves it and its made good, looks nice",
"This phone was used very few times, after four months good service it went dead.  I called the company, it was still under warranty, but I just got a run around.  I wasted about five hours trying phone calls (and yes, it has been recharged) I was told to mail it back to the company, which I did, and it came back still not working.  I would suggest you never buy an LG product.  I am 83 years old and disabled and returning it to the store is not an option.  I bought it online and now I am stuck.  Carol Jones.  Carol19321@gmail.com",
Good band for the price.,
Great love the non clunky look.,
"I have gone through 3 sets of these in 2 months, that's 6 protectors.<br />The company doesn't respond and they are just too fragile. One set didn't adhere at all and just fell off, luckily I was able to return that one. But there are so fragile. One broke while playing a game tapping on the screen.<br /><br />Do not buy this brand",
Works well with fingerprint reader and touch screen. But it breaks super easy. Also the first set I got didn't stick to the screen and just popped off like the glue was old.,
The USB port just broke loose the 3rx time I used it. Cheaply built. I'll stick with a basic charger.,
"Very happy with this case. I tried several others including other Spigen cases, and this was my favorite.",
"I had this same case on my pixel 3 and loved it. However something about the pixel 6 just feels too nice to have such a cheap case. Spigen is great and I have a different model on my pixel 6 pro, but this one just looked and felt cheap on it.",
Beautiful paint and stays on very well. Seems durable and protective.,
"Was difficult to get on my iPhone 14 plus.  Once it was on the phone, the touch screen didn’t work properly.  It would take multiple “.touches “ to get the screen to recognize the “touch”.<br /><br />It appears that this case would be protective.  It isn’t flimsy.  It looked nice.<br /><br />Very difficult to remove.",
Better than expected.  Very nice looking case.  Quality materials.  Fit my iPhone 14 plus perfectly.,
"This is a thin, cheap case.  It was inexpensive, so I shouldn’t be surprised.  The back is just thin plastic.  It is clear, I thought it would be black.  The edges of the case are a bit thicker.  I doubt this is very protective.  It does fit the Apple phone 8 plus, perfectly.",
"I have purchased a couple watch bands recently and they had the same issue.  They weren’t long enough.  The band was closed on the largest setting.  If my wrist was a tad larger, the band would not have fit. I am not a large woman.<br /><br />The band itself, was nice.",
I bought this work station for my brother all I have to say this one is the high quality work station very solid and high tech for serious profecional people<br />Exellent quality superrior laptop hope will make my brother happy,
"not as advertised, does not have the nvidia quadro 1000m card in it, does not have the 2.2ghz processor in it. not as described, i would be weary of this seller. have not responded to me yet so, ratings could change.",
"Best deal I could find during Cyber Monday!!! They beat out anything I could possibly get at Lenovo, even with their best Cyber Monday deals. This is because they upgrade the system themselves with high quality additions (i7 CPU from Intel which Lenovo didn't offer) AND they provide 3 year warranty on their upgrades ON TOP of the 3 year warranty they already got from LENOVO!  WOW WOW WOW! That's all I had to say. Product shipped fast and arrived much earlier than promised, all despite the holiday season and Cyber Monday craziness.",
"This really is a beautiful laptop, elegantly designed with a rich, quality feel to it.  The bottom of the laptop has an almost suede like feel to it and the packaging only enhances the feel of luxury.  It doesn't seem to fully fulfill the requirements of an ultrabook, it is definitely an aesthetically elegant machine.<br /><br />As for Specs, the i5 with 500 Gig hard drive is plenty beefy, especially at the price that Amazon is selling this for.  It would be nice to have a little more memory but that is an easy upgrade.  We have used this for light gaming, mostly mine craft and it handles that with no problem.  I don't know that this would be a stellar gaming laptop though, but it is a rock solid personal laptop.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with it, is my own personal frustrations over windows 8.  I'm getting there with familiarity, but still having problems with Microsoft having spent decades teaching us how to navigate and work with computers to have them arbitrarily take easy control from us. But that's a rant for another time.<br /><br />I have to admit that windows 8 looks sharp and stellar on this machine.  The video is clear and crisp.  We have watched streamed videos and they are great, with no lag.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the look and feel.  That and the very decent specs make this a great priced laptop at around $700.",
"I am disappointed with it.<br />- it is quiet heavy comparing to other ultrabook.<br />- the touch pad does not run smoothly, and difficult to press right click.<br />- the quality of display is bad comparing to other laptop, especially when playing videos.<br />I must return it after a week. Then the seller (Bestdeal Tech) charge me 20% restocking fee. It is really bad to me.<br />However, I think it is worth for me to return it and get another labtop.",
good,
"My company has used Dell workstations for as long as I have been employed (which is nearing the 10 year mark), but this was my first venture into the world of Dell laptops, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this affordably priced offering. First off, the specs are impressive for such a low-priced laptop. 4 GB's of RAM, 500 GB's of storage, 1.8Ghz processor, and a middle of the line nVidia graphics card is a steal of a deal at the current price Amazon is selling this laptop for. The first thing you'll notice that might make your eyes pop is the shipping weight of 7.8 lbs! Fear not though, I put this laptop on my trusty scale and the results came back as 4.2 lbs (.4 lbs lighter than advertised). I also have a 13.3 Macbook Pro with Retina Display, which weighed in at 3.4 lbs. So if you're looking for a laptop that you'd like to do a lot of traveling with and you can afford paying almost three times as much, you might be better off looking at a Macbook or a Macbook Air. If you can't afford jumping up to the price of an Apple, this laptop will still be very convenient to tote around as it is very slim and sleek.<br /><br />Setting up this laptop was extremely easy, as I was able to immediately connect it to my home WI-FI system. This was my first experience with Windows 8, and I must admit it was a bit jolting, but I was able to get used to it after a while. The next paragraph I'm about to type is by far the most important and useful one to read, so if you're going to ready any paragraph, please read the one below.<br /><br />This computer came with a trial-version of McAfee anti-virus software. That means that you get the software for a trial period, but then you have to pay for it in order to keep getting virus definition updates. Let me save you a lot of time and money, DELETE THIS FROM YOUR COMPUTER AS SOON AS YOU SET IT UP. This sounds extremely backwards, but let me explain. Microsoft has been providing free anti-virus software for Windows users for years via download. The software is called Microsoft Security Essentials, and is superior to all third party virus programs in the way that its free and also that it comes straight from Microsoft, who is always the first company to know when an issue has come up because the issue involves their own software. Companies like McAfee and Norton get their information from Microsoft, so there is always a lag. For Windows 7 and prior, you would need to download Microsoft Security Essentials in order to get the anti-virus protection, but with Windows 8, it is already installed via a beefed up version of Windows Defender that includes Microsoft Security Essentials. The trick is, and this is important, you have to remove any third party anti-virus program before being able to turn on Windows Defender. Microsoft had to do this in order to avoid getting sued by the big anti-virus companies, but make no mistake about it, YOU DO NOT NEED TO PAY FOR ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION EVER AGAIN. Uninstall whatever was installed to begin with, re-start your computer, and turn on Windows Defender and you will be set. Anti-virus rant over!<br /><br />I've been using this laptop for the past several weeks and could not be happier with it. The screen resolution is impressive, and the built-in webcam works great for Skyping. In the past I have been impressed with Dell for the workstations I've used at my company's office, but now I can appreciate them even more for creating a high quality affordable laptop.",
awsome product. i recommend,
"This is an initial, first glance/use review. I will hopefully update it in a few months after continued, heavy use. Ihave had it for 5 days, and this is my impression.<br /><br />Initially, out of the packaging, it is a sleek, minimal looking machine with very nice specs. In a world with countless laptops and configs, this is a nice middle of the road laptop for a fair price at $650.<br /><br />The laptop does boot/hibernate/wake/sleep very fast, which is nice. The track pad is very nice for a pc, not the same as the macbook, but close, and I find it to be intuitive, and easy to use. The battery is impressive for a pc, and I am able to get a solid 6 hours out if, which I appreciate, although you have to alter a few settings.<br />The screen is nice, and does have limited viewing angles, but I find that to be minor as I usually sit directly in front of it.<br /><br />Windows 8 is nice on this machine, just learning it, but am doing so fast.<br /><br />I recommend and 8GB ram upgrade to use it to max potential. It only has one slot up to 8GB, so be warned. I got a 1 x 8 GB crucial stick and it is working great.<br /><br />The performance is great for day-to-day basics, and light gaming, and all MS Office applications.I have also installed Photoshop and will update to let everyone know how that works.<br /><br />I love this laptop for the price (i paid $649), and would recommend it for the money v. performance factor.<br /><br />It is very sturdy, but still light enough for carrying/traveling. I am impressed with Dell and the product they put out on this machine.<br /><br />***UPDATE 11/20/2015***<br /><br />I have been using this laptop for over a year now, and they say distance makes the heart grow fonder and proxitimity breeds contempt, this is true for this laptop. Windows 10 is a big NO, maybe a fresh install will help. It has been sluggish for the past 14 months, it just doesn't perform. Every action is delayed, the drivers have been a continuous battle, and still my brightness is stuck ALL the way up. The machine has &#34;impressive specs&#34; but just has under performed in all sectors. it just doesn't do anything well and weighs way too much. I had said it wasn't an issue, well the honeymoon is long gone and weight is an issue. I am going to fresh install 10 and hopefully that will clean up performance some, but overall I am dissatisfied with this product. The WiFi connection is super crappy as well, good luck finding wifi. I will be getting a Chromebook in the mean time, at least if it under performs I can remember I only spent $150 on it.",
Worst laptop ever made when it did work for the first month I had it. At least now that it broke 6 weeks into owning it I can at least go find a decent computer that will work. Amazing how it breaks right past the time I can return it tho,
nice,
The most expensive purchase,
"Embedded memory is small, it is better to have more memory. I am  satisfied with this computer when I have no strong performance requirement",
amazing computer,
Love it... get the glow in the dark keys for dark room use,
"If you are looking at a T540p computer I recommend you run, don't walk towards another model of computer.  Having come from an excellent T520 laptop that was due back on lease return, I found this latest large format laptop a massive step backwards from previous Lenovo offerings.  While the laptop has good performance, the ergonomics on the laptop are terrible, as was Lenovo's decision to change the AC power adapter plug design.  Have some extra 20v power adapters from previous generation Lenovo computers?  Too bad, while voltage and amperage remain identical to the previous generation of power adapters, they change the plug to a rectangular design ensuring new spares must be purchased.<br /><br />If you are someone who likes to keep your fingers on the home keys and use the TrackPoint and mouse buttons the new ""ClickPad"" touchpad on this device will drive you insane unless you disable the touchpad.  Why?  Because the touchpad and mouse buttons are integrated into one piece resulting in your mouse moving when you move your thumb over to left-click on the top-left corner of the touchpad.  Conversely, if you are a touchpad user, you are likely to be quite fond of the ""ClickPad"".<br /><br />Signs of cost-costing are everywhere on the computer including:<br /><br />- Super-thin materials and soft screws on the hard drive and memory covering door<br />- Thinner casing material overall that increases flex of all parts of case<br />- Zero status lights (no hard disk, battery or wireless lights) (Just a stupid illuminated dot in the ""ThinkPad"" logo on the back side of the laptop display (thanks for that form over function decision Lenovo))<br />- No latching mechanism for the display (though I suppose this was something that may have broken for some on old models)<br />- Flimsy CD tray<br /><br />Cost-cutting measures are probably inevitable in the ultra-competitive computer segment, but just beware that the once rock-solid feel to ThinkPad models of old is simply not here.  This leaves me with the following overall summary of the T540p model:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Excellent battery life<br />- Keyboard button to lock operating system (useful if you like to secure your computer before you walk away)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Thin, materials and easily damaged screws to hard drive access panel<br />- Poor speaker location (they are simply downward facing slits in the front of the case)<br />- Hardware specific functions shared with the function keys are now primary instead of secondary<br />- No longer any dedicated hardware buttons for volume, speaker and microphone mute or wireless<br />- Fixed CD/DVD drive means no Ultrabay option.  A big negative if you liked the ability to add a second internal hard drive as well as being able to easily swap out said second drive.<br />- Terrible ""ClickPad"" touchpad design for TrackPoint users results in left-click mouse button being too far left for activation with right thumb if you work that way<br /><br />Other things to be aware of:<br />- Hardware specific functions shared with the function keys are now primary instead of secondary which means if you use F5 for Refresh or F3 for Next in Windows a lot you will either be annoyed to have to press the Fn key as well or remember to press the Fn+Esc key to lock the FnLk key on to make Functions active.<br />- Windows 8.1 power management does not work well with some T540p models.  This may vary based on graphics processor and display panel chosen, but on my model you cannot dim the display and when the display is turned off by power management, the screen turns blank, but power is not actually cut (it glows dimly instead of actually being powered off).  These anomalies do not occur if you use Windows 7 or 8.<br />- The off-center keyboard is not an issue when the laptop is resting on a surface, but if you put it on your lap and use it from there you may find the offset annoying or less than natural feeling<br /><br />Overall, this is a very disappointing product and by far the worst ThinkPad laptop I have used in the last 10 years in terms of ergonomics and material quality.",
"Lenovo really upped their game with this redesign. As a long time Thinkpad user I agree that while the design change is different, those who take the time to adapt themselves to the changes are rewarded with the highest Thinkpad experience yet! I absolutely love my T540p. Quality is slightly higher overall compared to previous generations. The trackpad is an absolute delight to use, I can't help but smile as I type this review on it right now. I upgraded mine with a Samsung 840 EVO and I have to say, any program that I want to load loads instantly. I will need to buy one more of these for my wife. She already noticed it and can't wait to get her paws on it.",
Awesome!,
item arrived on time. item was as described.,
"pretty good, bought it for my new computer and works well, adjustable and clear view, the only thing bad is... after 10 days i bought it, the price of it falls from 179 to 129...",
This monitor has a beautiful bright screen with rich colors and a stylish slim bezel. Looks and performs just great.,
"Good picture, Could be better, but still very crisp",
Good quality but was told I was getting an LED monitor but ended up getting an LCD monitor so that's was false advertising and when I was testing out the monitor with my PS4 I saw a dead pixel which made my eye go right t it because it was so out of place. Other wise good packaging and pretty good quality I ended up sending it back and chose a different monitor.,
Great product. A good buy.,
"The monitor is really nice, hooking with the HDMI interface, the speakers work well and great video.",
"Great quality and price, fast shipping",
Looks great buts starting to shimmer a bit after about a month worth of use,
"seller listed with 16GB, but I received a 8GB model",
"Lenovo is an excellent computer, does everything I could ask of it.<br />Seller was prompt, and exceptionally fat getting it to my door.",
"great product; I have installed server 2012 r2 on this machine(as a virtual machine), in a dual boot with the host OS windows 8.1, which I upgraded to 8.1 pro pack.<br /><br />great performance...<br /><br />great pc.",
"Great laptop. RAM is upgradeable to 16GB.<br />The battery life could be better as well as the overall weight of the laptop. It's a bit heavy.<br />Other than those two complaints, I absolutely love this laptop.",
As good as expected!,
"I looked at a lot of gaming laptops trying to get  the best bang for my buck since I didn't want to spend more than fifteen-hundred on one.  I finally boiled it down to between this, the ASUS ROG G750, and the MSI GE60 laptops.  In the end the tipping point was the video card as the 870m is the highest end mobile card unless you want to pay about five-hundred more for the current flagship the GTX 880m.  Apparently the 870 is noticeably better performing than the 860 (according to notebook check) which all the other gaming laptops have at this price point.  The processor is roughly equivalent to competing models, and while this model has less RAM it still has plenty and can more can be added later relatively inexpensively.<br /><br />Unfortunatelyl the first one I got was faulty and had to be returned as it randomly locked up whenever the video card was ran even moderately hard no matter the game or drivers used.  Luckily Amazon shipped a replacement immediately and this one has been a beast.  So far I have thrown Age of Wonders 3, Company of Heroes 2, Planetside 2, and Dawn of War 2 (a lot of sequels!) with max settings and still get above 50fps.  While none of these are bleeding edge games designed to push your card to the limits I am very satisfied with the performance on a mobile platform with modern games especially Planetside where things get hectic in large firefights.<br /><br />The sound is pretty great (I have never had a sub-woofer inside a laptop before), the keyboard is nice on the hands while being responsive and I especially like the amount of control you have over the back lit keyboard colors even if it is minor in the grand scheme of things.  The touchpad kind of sucks but that's because they blow in general and there isn't much help for that.  It does however automatically disable whenever it detects another pointing device which can be overridden by a handy physical key near the pad.  The screen is high-resolution and looks great out of the box and I haven't had to adjust anything yet.  I find the casing aesthetically pleasing, solid, and a bit flashy which a gaming rig aught to be.  The only 'downside' I have found so far is as a 17.3&#34; gaming laptop this thing is not light or small, and the power brick is the size of my foot.  If you find those characteristics unacceptable then you're shopping for the wrong laptop.<br /><br />Given the performance you get for the price I find the MSI GT70 to be an outstanding bargain.",
"I had an Alienware from before they were a Dell and it was time for a new gaming laptop. I looked around at many. I didn't want to spend a ton, but didn't want to go extremely cheap either.<br />This works well for my gaming needs (steam, blizzard, etc.). I connect through wifi at home and am happy with it. Very portable if I do choose to take it with me elsewhere. The laptop is fairly light for a gaming laptop, not to say that it is feather light though!<br />The best bang for the buck from others I have seen in this same price point.",
"Long lasting battery,  tough design,  good  keyboard and screen.  The only down side to this is the operating system.  Maybe it is just me but the it just does not seem to interface with the new Windows well.  It is probably more due to the operating system than the hardware but it seems to jump from screen to screen on the internet in an unexpected manner.",
"Great laptop, handles everything from email to online gaming smoothly.  Very heavy to travel with, especially with the brick transformer that is the charger.  For desk top use, it's excellent.  For travel I'd go with something lighter because it gets heavier the longer you carry it.",
"This thing is a BEAST!!!!  I have had it for about a year now and restarts so fast (I dropped a sold state drive into it).  it also runs quietly, plays any games I want, and orders pizza fast af.  Great little laptop!",
I bought this laptop for my som specifically for playing WOW. He can play it at the highest video settings and does not experience any lag or other issues. It does get warm so a cooling pad is a must!,
it was (doa) would not power on at all sending it back for  another one hope it works want to give msi one more shot,
great!,
Great Gaming Machine.,
"I bought the previous model of this laptop about 18 months ago at about this price from Best Buy.  Since then I have sent it in twice for RMAs and it's broken again after I installed their factory image, MS Office, Dropbox and some other normal applications.<br /><br /> - The customer service is awful.  They are totally unapologetic and act as if I've done something wrong.  They said &#34;did you install non MSI software?&#34; as if I wasn't supposed to use MS Office.  Both times when I sent in the computer I didn't hear anything for a month, and when I called they said they hadn't gotten it and acted like it was my fault unless I could produce a tracking number.  When I found my tracking number (I had just moved and it wasn't at my fingertips), they said they didn't have it at first but that they would look into it.  A few days later I got the laptop back in the mail.<br /> - The website is awful.  It's slow, hard to navigate, and it was hard to register the product.<br /> - Although they've replaced many of the components, twice, I still get really insidious errors when I'm doing work, and it looks like there's a problem with the application.  But, if I do anything remotely memory intensive, like install Windows updates, I'll get a BSOD.  (Blue Screen Of Death), which says that it's a hardware issue.  The upsetting part is that after two fixes I get BSODs frequently as soon as I've gotten the computer back.  This tells me they didn't test it.  I could see that happening once, but not twice.<br /> - I'm waiting to send it back in a third time now, but they botched up the mailing label and refuse to change it.  I've been waiting two weeks for a response.<br /><br />I don't trust this company.  I don't think they're ready for the consumer market, they're used to being a supplier for internal computer parts, and it really shows.  There's a reason that they're so competitively priced compared to other gaming laptops.<br /><br />BTW, I have never used a game on this machine (not even Freecell!).  I bought it for the processing speed to do data analytics.  Unfortunately, it's cost me more than I paid because I've spent so much time restoring my system and tracing errors that I thought were caused by software, but were actually hardware related.",
"As always, Alienware makes good computers.  This is my third, the first tow being towers.  I have a 12 year track record with Alienware and all systems were powerful and reliable.",
"I love everything about this computer. Ordered and came within 2 days (on prime). Works perfectly. The thing is stupid fast. Beautiful looking and the lights are gorgeous. The sound is amazing...louder than my tv. Great comp. Can handle a ton of downloading while watching movies in 1080p without slowing down, overheating, or even making fan sounds. Runs very quietly. It feels nice on the hands, good materials. Strong but feels soft around the keyboard area. Basically, great purchase, very happy.",
"I wanted to wait for a bit before reviewing this model. It didn't have very many reviews and that made me a bit skeptical but I am SO glad I purchased this particular model!<br /><br />I am one of those people who read lots of reviews before buying anything. I was thinking about getting the 11.6 Acer because it had way more reviews. Someone rating this Chromebook mentioned the exterior being susceptible to dirt because it's white. That actually influenced me and it was totally unfounded. The casing is so strong that it feels like it could withstand just about anything and wipes clean so well. This is my second Chromebook--my first being the classic Samsung Chromebook I bought a couple of years ago. That one still works but was built very flimsily. It always irked me that the bevel was so cheaply made. This puppy is solid plastic. Recently my Chromebook dropped hard on the floor and was good to go. I don't even feel the need to carry it a protective case, although I try to use a padded backpack as often as possible. No scratches due to such a material for the cover. Awesome.<br /><br />I wanted a better viewing experience than my Chromebook. Verdict? Same deal. Matte screen, viewing angles no better. Solution? Watch videos straight ahead! LOL! Maybe someday I will also get the HD 15-inch Chromebook for that sort of thing but for now I am all good.<br /><br />The keyboard is very springy, which I love cuz my fingers can get to flying sometimes. Track pad is good. I bought a floor model of this on Amazon so guess how much I paid? Around $165! Can't beat it with a stick. $90 less than my first Samsung Chromebook (albeit used versus new but this was barely used. I sure can't tell.)<br /><br />Battery life is awesome. I think I get at least 8 hours for this used model. That was another reason I bought a new computer. I would have had to replace the battery on my old raggedy Chromebook and that ain't cheap.<br /><br />So color me impressed and pleased as punch with this baby.",
"I am new to chrome and the whole google world. I picked up this chromebook to somewhat challenge myself to learn something new.<br /><br />I basically write a lot, online and offline. I really like the lightness of the chromebook since I sometimes use it on my lap. Also, it doesn't generate much heat, only minimal heat, and it is absolutely silent. The battery also last very long, even with the screen on full brightness. The keyboard is really nice, although it doesn't have several keys that most keyboards do (End, Home, Caps lock, Delete, etc). I had to learn the shortcuts to these, and that is fine.<br /><br />Since I also edit text, I need a mouse. The responsiveness to the mouse is a little slow, I find that the trackpad works much better than the mouse, but then again, highlighting is a pain without a mouse, so I am trying to find the perfect setting to it. That said, I dislike not being able to turn off the trackpad while the mouse is present.<br /><br />I also find that the power plug is a bit flimsy, so I recommend charging and unplugging while in use. The plug seems to want to break and is very loose, so as a precaution, I like to put it aside.<br /><br />But I like everything else about this technology. I watched a soccer match, HD, full blast volume, live. No complains. The machine is quick to turn on.  I am still hesitant to recommend it because I haven't used it offline, but it seems like I am going to be okay. Also, with the 4Gb RAM, I've had no problem browsing or opening tabs.<br /><br />So far, so good.",
The chrome book was great but in just a few weeks the screen started separating from the lid and no one wanted to help me. If I would have got help it would be five stars but since I'm stuck with a broken computer not so much.,
"The device functions exactly as advertised.  Use of the NVIIA Tegra K1 makes this perfect for low power consumption and reasonable speed.  If you have several (more than 3 or 4) windows open at once, you might experience a sluggish performance.<br /><br />The device architecture limits its ability to load alternate operating systems - read up before you purchase.",
"We bought the lower resolution screen and 4GB RAM version as a refurb on Amazon for $205 and what an incredible computer it is! I read many of the reviews by computer sites and they didn't like the performance of the Acer but those reviews were written before Google updated Chrome OS to support the Nvidia processor. By the time I bought ours, the update was available and it was installed the first time I booted it up and it has run great, right from the get-go. I chose the lower res screen based on other reviews. Users were complaining about the small size of objects on the higher res screen. 13&#34; is pretty small to display 1080p.<br /><br />This is our second Chromebook. The first was a Samsung with an ARM processor that we bought 3 years ago so we weren't new to Chromebooks. (this Acer is much more powerful though).<br /><br />Chromebooks can do almost anything a Windows computer can do. In fact the only thing I use Windows for anymore is to run Quicken and if I switched to Mint.com then I could forget about Windows altogether. The most common complaint I see from people who haven't tried Chromebooks is that they fear living without Microsoft Office. All you need is an Outlook.com email account and you can use Microsoft's Office online for free. You can use it either with the free MS Onedrive (15GB storage in the cloud) or with your Dropbox account (just install the Dropbox Chrome extension). Of course, there is nothing wrong with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. They work if you're connected to the internet or not and they just look like the older MS Office 2003 apps. In my opinion they are better than the MS Office apps.<br /><br />Major advantages of Chrome OS over Windows.<br /><br />Chrome OS is a small operating system and runs well on cheaper hardware. If you had a bad experience with a Windows XP netbook you know they barely worked and once they were a couple of years old, they were so slow you regretted buying one. This is not a problem with Chromebooks.<br /><br />You don't need to install antivirus software.<br /><br />You don't need to defragment your hard drive.<br /><br />Updates are a much better experience on a Chromebook.<br /><br />Chromebooks don't slow down over time like Windows PC's do.<br /><br />Any apps you use are all web-based and therefor they are automatically updated. If you have a Windows computer with locally installed programs you have to manually update those and it's a comparative pain and if you don't update them you risk security problems.<br /><br />You can buy cheap Windows computers these days but that is only because of competition from Chromebooks and the cheap Chromebooks will outperform any cheap Windows machine. If you haven't tried a Chromebook yet you really should try one if you have WiFi.<br /><br />(more info on Chromebooks at  http://bibleplan.net/cwh/CWH_ChromeBook1.pdf)",
The screen is to only 13&#34; make difficult to watch movie,
"This is a great Chromebook. My second one and this is far superior to the HP I also own. Very attractive, light weight and works like a dream. I use it in conjunction with my desktop and regular laptop as there are some times when I need a harddrive capability that is not available with the Chromebooks.",
I was ready for an upgrade from my HP laptop and decided on a Chromebook since I use Google Docs for work. Love the 4G of memory as that helps me keep 12 tabs open at once while still surfing the net! Coming from Windows 8 and using Chrome OS has been a pleasure! Also a long battery life and low res screen has been a plus!,
"Bought for our kids last Christmas, but I like it so much that it has become my my laptop replacement.",
Nice computer.  Very fast and good screen resolution.,
"Bought this on another site for my wife as a present and this laptop has failed to deliver in every respect.  This is the only 1 star review I have ever given a product.<br /><br />1) The display is terrible. I had better viewing angles on 10 year old monitors<br /><br />2) The track pack is crap and seldom recognizes multiple touch gestures.  I'll tap with two fingers maybe five times before the secondary click registers. And forget about the windows 8 gesture swipes, maybe 5 times to get those to work too.<br /><br />3) The click portion of the track pad is even more clunky and disappointing.<br /><br />4) The absolute worst thing about this laptop is the tablet functionality. It NEVER works. The touchscreen has worked maybe 5 times in the 3 months we have had it.  I have tried various fixes online and none work. I finally contacted ASUS and they said to reinstall some drivers. Surprise surprise that didn't work either. I don't have time to keep messing around with their customer service and my wife uses it for work and can't afford to lose it.  The tablet functionality was the only reason I bought this laptop, which is overpriced in every respect when you take away the touchscreen. So now we are stuck with an overpriced laptop with a &#34;touchscreen&#34;. Thanks ASUS, you apparently have great quality control standards.<br /><br />5) This is just the icing on the crap-tastic cake.  When the touchscreen has worked, the fliplock only seems to work 50% of the time on the first use and rarely ever worked the second time (that is if the touchscreen worked after transition between the two modes, which again was seldom).  In any event accidental key presses and trackpad presses interfere with the tablet mode.<br /><br />Pure junk. Clearly defective. Never will I buy ASUS again.",
"I am loving this computer already.  I have not had a lot of time yet to figure out all the features, but so far, it is GREAT!!! I am currently traveling and with the reputation of being versatile and durable, I am expecting this will work out perfect.  I like that it folds and can be used as a tablet, and I love the touch screen feature.  I noticed that the computer tech, who came to this village to repair the internet, had chosen this as well for his own personal use.  No problems so far and looking forward to great success.",
"Very slow for a 6GB RAM laptop, but I'll say that at least 50% of that is Windows 8.1 and another 20% contributed to the i3 4030 chip.  The thing I hate, that I must now fix is the lack of an optical drive.  You absolutely cannot ship a new pc of any kind without an optical drive!!! Come on man!  One other thing I would mention is that the 5400RPM drive is painfully slow.  If you can spare a little to give it a decent size SSD and re-install everything it would make it far more usable and you'd enjoy the user experience a lot more.",
"The Touch-Screen Laptop is a joy to use. It is fast, ​and I love to flip it over to use the virtual keyboard. I am currently using it with a mouse since I like this better, but with the touch screen it is no big deal when I forget the mouse. Overall this is a quality laptop, and I can recommend it highly.",
"This ASUS Flip laptop is amazing. It is slim like a ultra book and is fast. The tablet/laptop feature is amazing and makes it easy to turn this laptop into a tablet just by pushing the screen backwards. For 439, this is one of the best deals out there. It has all the features I look for in a tablet as well as great games and apps for the tablet mode. Overall it is a great buy!",
loving it. great product. great value. you wont regret.,
"I've only had this a few days but it seems pretty easy to get to know.  It didn't come with any word processing software but I found a free download which works just fine on it (Apache OpenOffice).  It's so light and slim, makes my 5-yo laptop look like a dinosaur.  It seems to run with a lot less heat than my old laptop, too.  Very cool (temp-wise) and very kool, too!  I'm a novice and heard many negative remarks about Windows 8.1, but have had no trouble learning how it works.",
"Very nice, love it...",
"The build quality of this laptop is very good, especially the aluminum case.<br />The i3 speed is decent, especially after having installed all the updates.<br />Also WiFi worked OK after getting the Windows Updates and reinstalling the WiFi driver.<br />Unfortunately, the 15.6 inch 1366x768 display is very grainy on the i3 model. The more expensive models have a 1920x1080 display.<br />There are also little dots all over the screen that I think are like an older touchscreen.<br />The worst part is that when playing chess on the unit as a tablet, the opposing party cannot see the screen due to the such a narrow viewing range.<br />All they can see is white. (which is good for me, because then I win!)<br />So the graininess and the inability for it to work as a true tablet and the narrow viewing angle is causing me to return it.",
Can't say enough bad things about this computer. Returned it twice to Amazon. That was the best part of the process. Amazon was very good with the return process. But in the end it still did not work out I think it's just a piece of crap computer.,
"A quite amazing piece of hardware, the only side down i see was register my product on MSI and the update to W10.<br />The Pre Installed software was ok, not so disturbing and some are necessary, but the Killer Lan under W10 system is not totally what I was expecting and with more time I had to configure all because is the slowest on downloads on home.<br /><br />But about the hardware, when my brother intended to upgrade his &#34;Decepticon&#34; Desktop pc with an GTX 970 and saw &#34;Melvia&#34; ( The Dominator Gt72) includes that GPU, he burned himself. Also equipped with the good old i7-4712HQ faithful  processor, is even today an outstanding topnotch tech and the extra APU Intel HD Graphics 4600 to switch to a an even more eco mode or boost up the system is a perfect Combo.<br /><br />The Dynaudio + Sound Blaster Cinema System is the most outstanding audio fidelity I ever hear on a High-End Desktop replacement PC, on my whole life.<br />The Steelseries Keyboard is a great stylish touch but talking about the feeling keyboarding when I program feels great and responsive.<br /><br />The aluminium chassis made it even more lighter than I thought compared to my old Toshiba Q 15'4 System, and the stylish is like looking an &#34;Autobot Lambo racing car&#34; transforming itself on a Laptop, brutal experience elegant.<br /><br />Screen is really fine, clear and bright colors, but lost some sight from the sides but not a big problem if you use an external screen to share the experience.<br />If you use Steam together a good Joystick this is almost like having a otherworldly console at home.<br /><br />The boxing and presentation with the MSI protective cloth for screen & Keyboard and out protective cloth was another premium touch to expect on a product like this.<br /><br />You live on another country or have to travel overseas? No problem mate, the Power Supply AC of this baby is like the one of PS4, Multi-voltage 110~240, so yuo only need to find a plug adapter for the power cord, and there you go, nothing more than that.<br /><br />For working on Game Design fulfills with All my demands, but still later I have to instal it a SSD to boost the system, and maybe go for better Ram arrangement far beyond the 12gb. But for the price at that date + the &#34;Back to School Discount&#34;, was an unbeatable Quality at an awesome price.<br /><br />Thanks always Amazon!",
"IT's GOOD. BUT, A LITTLE WORRY ABOUT KEYBOARD. IT SEEMS DON'T AS GOOD AS ANOTHER BRAND.",
Wonderful computer. I have had mine now for over a month and I have zero complaints. Very powerful hardware for playing games and it can be upgraded which is a huge money saver down the road. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a new gaming laptop.,
"Im in love with my computer. it has been a year and a half and so far the performance is atonishing.<br />Im using it for gaming and animation (Im using programas like Maya, Zbrush, C4D, all Adobe programs, 3DS Max etc etc) and it always runs smoothly.<br />While rendering or heavy work it might get a bit hot but I activate the cooling booster and I have no further problems! (of course the cooling system makes some noice but its not that loud)<br />If I had to choose between an ASUS or Alienware, I would defenitely choose this computer again.",
Device is characterized by the availability of very excellent sound system and a great screen Keyboards colorful and glittery iPads luxury equipped to games at a reasonable price and a laptop is very high quality and excellent brand<br />1375$ excellent,
good product thanks for all,
"Amazing gaming laptop! Blazing fast, great features, awesome appeal and simply the epitome of bang for your buck. I had a hard time choosing between the ASUS ROG equivalent, the tie breaker between the two came down to upgrade-able hardware, on demand features on the laptops keyboard and Super Raid 3 technology.",
Great gaming laptop. If you play big 3D games I highly recommend you to buy this one. The laptop has a great screen and it's got two big fans to blow the heat out. I play GTA V online on high graphic settings for hours and it always stay very cool. It is a beast! I also bought it used from Amazon and it's no difference from brand new. It's one hundred bucks cheaper and the only thing you have to do is to install some drivers (which is provided in the box.),
Amazing computer. The 970m Is a beastly Card. I'm eventually going to put in a SSD to speed up the boot up time. This computer can handle anything you throw at it. Just remember that this is a heavy laptop and wont be as portable as the GS60/70,
"Laptop could take any game i though at it.  However, when i went to try and type on the keyboard after owning a half dozen or so dell laptops over the years i found that the keyboard just wasn't up to snuff.  About half of my keystrokes (no exaggeration) didn't register, especially the spacebar.  If i was just playing games that wouldn't be much of an issue but it was not possible to write a term paper.  I tried for 30 minutes and finally boxed it up and sent it back.",
"The bottom line for this laptop is that it's powerful beast in a very small package. If you want a 13&#34; laptop capable of running the latest games then it's a great option. It's not cheap, but contains some high quality components.<br /><br />Read on for a lot more detail:<br /><br />OVERALL CONSTRUCTION/BUILD<br /><br />My first impression on picking up this laptop is how light it is for a gaming laptop. Sure it's only 13&#34;, but I was expecting it to be feel more dense than it does at just around 4.5 pounds. The overall quality of the case is high. I would say that it's not quite as nice as the machined aluminum of a Macbook Pro, but it is light years ahead of some of the cheap plastic-feel laptops I have tried out. It definitely feels 'high quality' in your hands.<br /><br />The design features a glowing blue alien logo on the outside of the screen with a few glowing blue lines on a dark grey background. If you're looking for a &#34;professional&#34; looking laptop then this is probably not it, but considering it's branded with an alien theme - it's a lot more subtle than it could be. Personally I like the design.<br /><br />SCREEN This display on this laptop is a gorgeous 3200x1800 screen, and it looks awesome. The Amazon listing says the resolution is 2560x1440 pixels, but this is definitely incorrect - the one I got runs at 3200x1800 out of the box. The screen is bright and clear, and everyting I've tried out has looked great on it. I'm not personally a big fan of touch screens on laptops, but I tried it out for a while and everything I messed around with worked well. One reason I don't like touchscreens much is that I hate putting blemishes on my beautiful screen from oils off of my fingers, but I have to admit that even after using the touchscreen for a while there isn't really any noticible smudging at all. One minor annoyance with the touchscreen is that flicking away a bit of dust on the screen ends up opening up menus or moving my cursor. Not a knock on this specific product at all, just a personal preference.<br /><br />One thing to note is that with the 3200x1800 resolution on a 13&#34; screen, this laptop scales up content through Windows settings by default. Through &#34;Display&#34; -&#62; &#34;Make text and other items larger or smaller&#34; the default setting puts the scale up all the way. Most programs handle this scaling well, but it's possible that you will run into one that doesn't (like thie &#34;Alienware Product Registration&#34; that pops up, the text is microscopic). This isn't a knock on the laptop, just the reality of running such a high resolution on a smaller screen.<br /><br />KEYBOARD<br />The keyboard is surprisingly comfortable considering they had to cram it into a 13 inch laptop. The keys feel nice to the touch, and the space is used well. I'm especially happy to see that they found room for page up, page down, home, end, and delete keys. I use these keys often while programming, and I'm glad they're here. So far I've accidentally hit the page up/down keys a little too often, but I just need to get used to the keyboard. The palm rests are smooth and comfortable.<br /><br />There are also lots of customizable keyboard backlight options if that's your thing.<br /><br />TRACKPAD<br />The trackpad on this machine is not very good, it's the biggest negative in my experience with this product. It works alright I guess, but it's not anywhere near as smooth as the one on my Macbook Pro. Given that this is a only 13&#34; laptop, the trackpad is a good size and fairly comfortable to use - but the texture of the pad is a little rougher than I'd like and this leads to scrolling that's just not completely smooth - the cursor tends to jump and skip a bit as you move it across the screen. Right-clicking is also a little finicky, sometimes I end up left-clicking when I intend to right-click. Gestures work fairly well with one major exception:<br /><br />After setup I installed Chrome and started browsing around the web. The gesture behavior was extremely buggy in Chrome. It almost seemed completely random. Sometimes it would scroll correctly, sometimes it would snap the page to the top or bottom, it would often draw strange rectangles everywhere as I gestured. This behavior did NOT happen in Internet Explorer or Firefox, just Chrome. I tried to resolve it through driver updates but didn't have any luck. After research, it looks like the problem is with Chromium specifically, but I haven't been able to figure out a workaround. Here are two threads that have information on the topic:<br /><br />https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/BdaUw9boNSU<br />https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463350<br /><br />As a result, I'm not able to use Chrome at all, which is a definite bummer because Chrome is my usual browser of choice. I've been using Firefox and the scrolling works very well, but I'm disappointed I can't use Chrome.<br /><br />SPEAKERS<br />When I turned the volume all the way up on this laptop, I was honestly shocked at how loud these speakers are. It is MUCH louder than my 17&#34; Macbook Pro. The quality is decent, it doesn't compare to a nice Sonos speaker or anything - but it's excellent for a 13&#34; laptop. Not much bass, but boy are they loud.<br /><br />GAMES<br />If you're buying this computer then it's highly likely that you're a gamer. I've tried it out on a bunch of different games, I'll talk about them here. The framerates are GENERAL ideas of the fps I was getting, obviously these fluctuate a lot during gameplay. I used MSI Afterburner to get the numbers.<br /><br />Far Cry 4<br /><br />I loaded up Far Cry 4 and it crashed immediately after launching! Bummer! I spent a while on this until I found a random forum post that said that MSI Afterburner causes Far Cry 4 to crash, and sure enough they were correct. Unfortunately that means that I don't have actual fps time data for Far Cry 4. I can tell you that it autodetected 1920x1080 on High, and this was running fairly well - but I scaled it back to Medium and the gameplay was a lot smoother. I'll stick with medium.<br /><br />Fallout: New Vegas<br /><br />Fallout: New Vegas autodetected 1280x720 on High quality, and it ran at a solid 60 fps. I scaled it up to 1920x1080 at Ultra quality and it ran between 40-60 fps.<br /><br />Civilization V<br /><br />Civilization V is a good example of what I mentioned earlier in the review: Some applications just aren't built to run at such high resolutions. Civ V autodetected 3200x1800 and the main menu was all weird, centered in between big black emptiness in the middle of the screen (Some people talkig about it here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/0/864980734944032303/). The actual game worked ok though, but only ran at about 12 fps. I scaled the resolution down to 1920x1080 and it went up to about 20-22 fps. Frame rate isn't as important in an RTS as in an FPS, but there you go.<br /><br />The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings<br /><br />The Witcher 2 autodetected 3200x1800 at Low quality and ran at about 20 fps. I scaled it down to 1920x1080 and the framerate jumped to 35-50. I upped the quality from low to high and ended up with 22-32 frames per second. I'll also note that The Witcher 2 consistently crashed for me whenver I exited it, not sure why.<br /><br />BENCHMARKS<br />If you're into benchmarks, I ran a few with this machine right out of the box. I didn't try to optimize these scores at all, they are just what I got with the vanilla machine:<br /><br />3DMark<br />Sky Diver 1.0: 9209<br />Fire Strike 1.1: 3352<br /><br />I also timed reboot, and it was just around 10 seconds. Very fast.<br /><br />BATTERY<br /><br />It's hard to give information about battery life because tasks vary so wildly, but I just had a battery charge last a little over 4 hours through some web browsing, video watching, and programming.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />I decided to go with 5 stars for this laptop because I think for the correct customer it's an awesome product. I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could due to the lower-quality trackpad discussed above, but I don't feel it's worth taking off a full star for. I've put a lot of information in this review, and I hope it's enough to help you figure out if this is the right laptop for you. If there are any specific questions then leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to respond. I'll also be updating the review in the future as I use the laptop more and more. Best of luck making your decision!",
"I really love the Alienware 13-inch gaming laptop. Alienware is a pricier, upgraded gaming line from Dell.<br /><br />I bought a new Toshiba laptop last year, after years of living with a Gateway that was so bad it isn't even funny. The Toshiba laptop was a big upgrade for me, but it was nothing compared to this.<br /><br />The design is unique and interesting and fun. It comes in a large box with an alien emblazoned on the top. When you open it, the laptop's unique design is the first thing you will notice. The top corners are slanted and this makes it a lot easier to manipulate and hold.<br /><br />When you open the laptop, you will notice a small alien head centered above the keyboard. This is the power switch. Plug it in, the plug is highlighted with blue. Turn on the laptop, the keyboard has a blue backlight.<br /><br />There is a facial recognition password program provided as a trial. It is pretty neat, but it is a trial and you will have to pay to make it permanent. The benefit of this is that it should work for all the programs on your computer. I am opting to not buy this, so I can't tell you how well that part works. But for the initial login, it works well. If it can't read your face, because of insufficient lighting, there is a traditional password backup.<br /><br />Once I got going, the laptop pretty quickly and very easily transferred files and programs from my old Toshiba laptop through a Miscrosoft interface.<br /><br />The screen quickly resembled my old screen in layout, making operation easy.<br /><br />The big difference here is that the laptop has a touchscreen. Frankly, I am still getting used to this, but it does seem a lot easier to navigate and use. My husband has an Ipad and he is very familiar with this and frequently kids me about using the old trackpad.<br /><br />The resolution of the screen is brilliant. It is clear and the colors are vivid, making my old laptop feel like it had a standard definition screen and this has a high-def.<br /><br />For gaming, the Alienware seems to be great. I play an online game and the graphics are much more vivid and interesting. The game also seems to move faster, given the faster processors on this laptop. My old laptop was designed more for personal and school use, so the processor was slower. Games were more sluggish and 'choppy'.<br /><br />It is really a great laptop. Pricey, but worth it.",
"Currently going to school right now for Mechanical Engineering. I bought a Surface pro 4 and returned it on day 4. Just got my Alienware 13.3 and it can handle everything you throw at it. Runs all cad programs smoothly. My brother recommend Alienware, I thought at first it was just a gaming laptop but you can turn it to whatever. For the price and what you get out of it is amazing. Size it great and is not heavy. Battery life w/o being plugged in, I want to say I got 4 hrs out of it running cad on high performance, and streaming the Internet on low settings I got 5-6 which is honestly not bad at all. Definitely recommend this over any lap top! GPU is amazing",
Solid laptop. Very well designed. No issues at all,
Very good laptop with quite small size .The laptop perfoms several tasks with no issue .I do gaming and CAD on this laptopsand so far it has perfomed to my expectation .The 13 inch screen and size makes it portable enough to move around with it improving my mobility.,
"So I bought this laptop with the intention of replacing a macbook pro for using Ableton and Resolume.  The 4k screen is nice but two things completely kill this laptop.<br /><br />1.  The touchpad.  Anyone thinking the touchpad is usable or bearable is in denial.  You can't even scroll reliably without the cursor moving to some new place on the screen and eventually right click context menus popping up.  I even tried disabling the two finger tap and it didn't make much of a difference.  The cursor still flops around the screen.<br /><br />2.  The 4K screen is beautiful, but Windows DPI Scaling is not!  I tried various ways to increase/lower dpi, disable dpi, and it just wasn't working out.  At one point I went back to the 1080p resolution just to have it make everything appear fuzzy (adjusted cleartype a couple times).<br /><br />I didn't even attempt to play any games before I decided to return this and buy a 15&#34; macbook pro.",
Upon arrival critical battery failure. It says must be replaced. How is a NEW Laptop DEAD on arrival with a dud battery. I am highly upset!!!!!!!!!!,
"even though it says I didn't buy it, I used my dads Amazon account, this is by far, one of the best gaming PC's I've ever seen, it's a bit pricey but it's a good investment, alien ware has amazing fans so it shouldn't overheat, just an amazing and fast computer",
Dell/Alienware refused my warranty service after my laptop broke because it's garbage quality.<br /><br />Called many times and got the run around. Tech came and brought wrong parts. Afterwards never replied and my service was listed as COMPLETED even though NOTHING was done.<br /><br />Tech sent was incompetent and needed my assistance to open the system. How pathetic is that ? Person sent look like some random wal-mart shelf stocker. Absolutely no idea what she was doing...<br /><br />**CAUTION** YOU WILL HAVE MAJOR HEADACHE calling in for warranty service. Just google your own research. I am not the only one who has terrible quality and refused warranty service.,
"Signature  Editions: I received my laptop fast and it was well packaged .<br /><br />So far it's a BEAUTIFUL  machine.  Runs super fast, beautiful display,  easy to use responsive touch screen.<br />All in all so far this purchase was 100% worth the money!<br /><br />I bought this laptop primary for video editing which  I haven't used for yet. I will update my review once I've had it for a month.",
This is a very nice computer.  I like that it is much lighter than some other comparably high performance laptops.,
"I've had a bunch of these workstation Thinkpads, and in general they're getting slowly worse.  There are a lot of things to recommend this line generally, but as a user of previous versions, I have to say I'm not impressed.  Let's count the ways:<br /><br />- I bought the add-in hard drive bay for the ultrabay.  Of course since the thing got thinner the form factor on this stuff has changed.  No big surprise there, but the mechanism they designed for locking the 2.5&#34; drive into the bay doesn't work.  The drive at some point works its way free of the SATA connector and fails.  You have to unscrew the backplate (fun when you're on the road and don't have that screwdriver) to fix this since you can't jus eject the thing like you could with older devices.  Personally I've &#34;fixed&#34; it by jamming some foam into the slot between the bay and the drive so it stays attached.  Stupid.<br /><br />- Remember the rubber bands they had that you slid onto the side of your hard drive to put it into the laptop?  Nope, those are gone.  So if you still use spinning media its just going to jiggle around or slam into the floor when you drop this thing.  Again, older versions were better about this stuff.<br /><br />- Then lets talk about that missing ultrabay removal switch.  As I said you have to unscrew a backplate now and undo a very small screw and then push on the screwhole with your screwdriver (!) to eject the drive.  Seriously?<br /><br />- In general the keyboard is worse than before.  The 10-key pad is RIGHT NEXT to the other keys, so you'll often hit the calculator key or the numlock key when you meant to hit delete or backspace.  Yuck.  Getting used to it but if you're a programmer you're going to be frustrated with this thing.<br /><br />- The older docks used to &#34;click&#34; into place.  With this generation you're never quite sure if its actually connected or not.<br /><br />- The battery life is *still* pretty poor.  Not sure why when other laptops are getting better all the time.  Not a big problem for me, but still...<br /><br />But hey, its pretty thin and acceptably light.  Its still got a stiff metal frame.  The display is really decent.  The keyboard is good minus the issues noted above.  Boots quickly, etc.  Its fine.  Just not as good as it would have been if they didn't keep making these worse.",
This is a professional laptop. I manage hundreds of them at work and know how reliable they are. Lenovo also has a quick and professional repair using prepaid box shipped by Lenovo. I had to repair a non Thinkpad laptop made by Lenovo and boy it took nearly 2 weeks with prepaid shipping. A ThinkPad with an i7 for less than $1.2k was a good price. I went with the base model and bought an extra 24GB of ram and a 1TB Samsung self encrypting SSD to make it a workhorse for my consulting side job.,
"I purchased a W541 a year ago and absolutely love it.  I'm an embedded hardware and software developer (Embedded System Resources) and spend a lot of time in front of a computer, often using demanding applications such as CAD and FPGA design.  But as a consultant, I sometimes travel, so for the last ten years, my primary machine has been a laptop.  When in the office it is in a docking station with an external keyboard, mouse and monitor.  The W541 is a very fast machine (i7 quad core).  The external monitor I am driving is a 55 inch 4K.  The computer came with a hard drive that I replaced with a 500 GB SSD.  I also upgraded it from 8 GB RAM to 24 GB RAM and to Windows 10.  It ran W10 fine on 8 GB, but when I started thinking about virtual machines and stuff--well the extra memory was less than $100.<br />Part of what I like about this computer is that it is extremely capable without the dock.  The build in keyboard is one of the nicest I've ever seen on a laptop.  The touchpad has multi-touch capability for things like dragging (scrolling) and includes a pressure switch that can do left or right mouse clicks by just pushing on the touch pad.  I miss it when its docked!  The display is large for a laptop and full 1920 x 1080 HD.  The battery life is probably 6 hours in my usage case.  I've used it on some fairly long domestic flights without ever running it down.  The fingerprint reader is quite responsive.  The mini display port/firewire is a useful feature.  Overall just a very well thought out design.<br />Are there any negatives?  A few.  The video is a hybrid of Intel (on chip) and Nvidia.  The interaction between the two isn't quite what I would expect.  I would prefer to see it put more emphasis on the Nvidia when running on A/C power (including docked).  Also, while it has many video options when docked, one has to review them carefully, because there are limitations and interactions.  It can drive at least three monitors, but only certain types and certain resolutions on each port.  Even the internal mini DP can drive a 4K monitor, but only with exactly the right combination of ports and cables.  It was frustrating to initially learn the matrix and obtain the correct cables for the method that worked.  Also, all this power doesn't come free.  It is one of the heavier laptops on the market, and the power supply is at least twice the size and weight of my previous laptop's.  A laptop that may need over 200 Watts under certain circumstances has to have a power supply that can handle it.  Lenovo has been a bit too cautious, in my opinion, about power supply requirements.  I wouldn't mind traveling with a smaller PS, knowing that it might not put much charge in my batteries while running, or might even be depending a bit on batteries to meet peak demand.  I could always top it off overnight in the hotel.<br />But overall, I am very pleased with this computer.  It will probably be my primary computer for many years, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
"The W541 should be the flagship workhorse Thinkpad, IMO. It is exceptionally fast and reliable. I use it for pretty intense computation (hardcore MATLAB simulations) and it has never let me down. The classic touchpad is back with discrete mouse buttons to use with the trackpoint (thank god).<br /><br />I would buy it from the manufacturer with as little RAM as possible and the cheapest hard disk, and then install your own RAM and SSD. This isn't like an ultrabook were there options are soldered in, you can install them yourself with minimal effort.<br /><br />Opt for the IPS panel if you can afford it, or you need good visual fidelity for work. I didn't and I kind of regret it.<br /><br />It's heavier and wider than your average laptop. but if you are like me, that isn't very critical. The W541 is surprisingly thin, though. Much thinner than typical &#34;gaming&#34; laptops.<br /><br />The battery life depends a lot on what you are doing... but don't expect it to go all day with the standard battery. A couple of hours of moderate use, maybe.",
"This is designed as a CAD and Graphics workstation. CAD and 3D graphics require a center button mouse. That they built the previous version of this CAD workstation (W540)  without the three Trackpoint buttons means that the design team only knew about making media consumption laptops. So now these media consumption designers think that 3 buttons makes a Trackpoint experience. They have removed just about all of the tactile sensation of the Trackpoint buttons by flattening them out.<br /><br />The complaints of an off center track pad are probably by media consumers and those that do not use numbers and measurements. I understand the symmetry thing but the placement allow efficient touch typing.<br /><br />The Chiclet Keboard is a lost battle. IBM created a near perfect interface for laptop productivity. Lenovo is slowly destroying it.<br /><br />Otherwise this is an excellent high powered machine. I have wanted a number pad for years moving up from a T420 and X220 laptops; which by the way are still solid performing machines for Fusion 360 and other CAD and Graphics programs.<br /><br />The main reason For purchasing this was to drive a 4K, 55 inch monitor.  CAD work is now an incredible experience with all that workspace.<br /><br />I feel sorry for anyone stuck with the W540 but now there is a replacement touch pad that contains the actual 3 buttons just like this W541.",
Used by engineering student for simulations and design (Solidworks). Works well but having a second display for doing software is very helpful.,
Excellent computer!,
"I was given this as a work computer and it is excellent. The island style keyboard is full sized and easy to use and navigate, and it comes with the numeric pad as well. The docking station is crucial, it allows HDMI and has a built in lock. The Lenovo bloatware is not enjoyable but that is to be expected. I routinely run SOLIDWORKS solid models and assemblies with no problems.",
"We bought this for our college student, and I have never been so unhappy. It has all kinds of issues - the screen blinks, it doesn't respond properly, the highlighting doesn't work, etc.  We called Lenovo and we did multiple s/w updates, and spent hours on the phone with them.  It still didn't work.  Their solution was to send it to them so that they could fix it. This would leave her without a computer for more than a week while in college so she's been stuck with it. The only solution is when she is home for spring break, we need to take it in and have to pay $50 to have one of their reps look at it.  In addition, we will need to do this process 3 times before they will replace it if this continues.  Finally, when I elevated this with Lenovo's management, I was supposed to get a call back from a manager which never happened.  I would never buy a lenovo again -- the thought of having to pay $50 to get a computer fixed that we paid $1000 for is outrageous. Nearly everyone at her school owns an Apple, and now I know why.",
Ive had this machine for just under 9 months and have had no issues... Until today.<br /><br />Mouse pad became unresponsive so I was navigating using keys.  Then the screen flickered and went out.  Upon startup I get a series of beeps 3:3:1 which gives a DIMM /System Board diagnosis<br /><br />Bummer... I have two OLD Dells laying around that just won't die (or run solidworks)<br /><br />I tried taking a pic of the problems but the beeps aren't showing up,
"This was our worst purchase ever. We have had nothing but problems - the screen blinks, the mouse has a delay, the highlighting doesn't work sometimes, etc, etc,  This computer was definitely a lemon. It was brand new and the only installed s/w was microsoft office.  We called Lenovo and did all the s/w updates that they requested, and the problems were still there.  After multiple phones calls, our only choices were to send the computer back to them (which would leave my daughter who is at college without a computer --- even one that barely works is better than nothing) or go into one of their service centers to have them take a look which they charge you $50 to do. Again, not an option since she is in a college town with no Lenovo service providers.  We spent hours on the phone with them, elevated the ticket, and the manager who was supposed to call us back never called.  And, to top it all off, you have to bring it in 3 times to have it fixed before they will replace it.  Don't buy this computer. Buy an Apple which is what most students have at her school or buy something cheaper that may actually work.",
Perfect performance specially with SSD drive,
"Weaker Passmark CPU scores, weaker Quadro Passmark scores than the older model Lenovo workstations... This is a piece of crap!",
The first one kept getting stuck when I tried to re-start it and I am aware this might be a W8.1 software problem but the keyboard also didn't consistently work so I sent it back and got a replacement. The replacement has same problem with not booting after a restart so I am still trying to see if I can fix this before sending it back again and looking for a different Notebook. Otherwise.... the computer is sturdy and very responsive. The keyboard is solid and the screen is beautiful. The fans are not that loud during games and if not playing a game you can barely hear them at all. It gets really hot when playing a game so a cooling pad is a must I think.  I really like this Notebook and if the Start up problem is fixable I can only recommend it.,

Cute game. I am not that good at it but my kids are. We love Nik Wallenda!,

"Not sure what else can be said about Norton products. I have used them for years on all my desk and laptop computers. Easy to install and protects my hard-drives well. Not sure I see what one of the other reviewers stated about upsells from Norton (haven't seen them yet even after almost 3 weeks of daily use). Anyway, if you are looking for Antivirus software that can be easily installed on three of your devices, this is for you.",
"Save your money and purchase a good (i.e. Norton) security for your PC. Too many issues with this version. I have not tried the newer editions since I was so burned by this one, but I do see where the latest edition is $20 cheaper than this one. So, if you are into gambling and want to try the more recent version, maybe they got rid of all the bugs and glitches in this one. I still would recommend looking elsewhere to protect your pc.",
"I always use Norton as my PC security application (have for over 10 years). I prefer it to most others as I have never had any issues with worms or viruses. Of course, this 2011 version is now outdated and I would recommend that the intended purchaser go with the 2013 version to be sure to capture all recent updates (I now how the 2013 version of this app already purchased and installed on my HP. Highly recommend the Norton as your security application.",
"I found the Roxio Creator to be too difficult to work with, with issues occurring on and off all the time (bugs for sure). I couldn't get the editing down on this application, so I was never able to fully utilize it. I did however, use it fo video transfers which did seem to work well. Anyway, in looking at the other reviews out here it looks like others have had the same troubles I have had. Maybe with the 2013 version Roxio might get it right, but steer clear of the older versions out there.",
"I had a trial version of Microsoft Office which came with my laptop, so I was in the market for the full blown version that would work with my Vista system. This product was easy to use and install and walked me throught the entire process. I would highly recommend to anyone.",
"It's a great game,like it has so many types of Dragons. Amazing",
"For the amount of money, the app is good. BUT the interface leaves a lot to be desired. I have it for Roku so not sure if it's the same on each platform. When doing certain things like searching through your shows, you have to go through every.single.one.of.them. to get to the show you want, instead of having each show in it's own section like other apps. Also, if you are searching through your shows and you click on it and then go back, you go back to the very beginning. When looking through 'recorded shows', you scroll through a ton then you can hit see more and again it takes you back to the beginning. The show selection is good and I am happy with that part of it but it gets old doing all the scrolling when they could improve the interface and make it a lot easier to see what you have to watch. Also, you cannot always find shows in the search section, it is odd and another one of Frndly's weird features.",
"Cheaper to buy the amazon upgrade versus paining Apple's high price.<br />to be honest I wonder at times why I do this every year. the features really aren't any better each year. I don't have a lot backed up but do have some.<br />I haven't hung a website up so why?<br />keeps an email available to me, my wife and daughter to communicate with. Yes I have gmail and hotmail but both have been spammed and taken over even w/ password changes.<br />so i pay the fee and upgrade thanks to amazon",
fun app,
not that good a much better app is  Cross Stitch World,
"Been playing in anticipation of a Vegas trip.  Both blackjack and slots.  Earning free buffet trips, discounted shows a d rooms without spending a dime.",
Fun!!!!,
Lot of fun but can be very frustrating only because I'm a Moron @ times while playing the game.Made me laugh @ myself and try harder.Just a fun SIMPLE. game.,
YES PLANNING MY 30 day tomorrow,
My favorite music app.,
Bought it at Best Buy. Best gadget in awhile. Way to go Amazon;,
Love these free channels I can get with my Firestick.,
"I like this game ok... but wish there were less that you must purchase.  Eh.  I'll play until I get tired of the pay for this, pay for that.  Eh.  Wish it could be the good old days and you could play a game for fun.",
"The app works... but... in general I just don't think there is enough content to justify the additional streaming costs.  I haven't found a single show that would make me think I needed to pay more.  Plus, I don't really appreciate that they make you pay to see some shows - new and/or reruns.  Eh.  I already pay way enough for my satellite subscription.  So, once my trial use is over - I'll cancel.",
I downloaded this app to my firestick and it works perfectly.  Love the access to all my streaming stuff AND my paid dish account.  Couldn't be happier.  Very easy to set up and use - step by step process that even I could do all by myself without the help of 10 year old grandson.  Win!,
"Mom (80 years old) likes to play mahjong type games and she chose this one.  I hate ads, but it what happens when you get a free app.  But it is time spender and Mom likes that it exercises her mind.",
"As time blowers go, this is a casino game crossed with a scrabble like word game.  It's a step up I think.  Fairly good win ratio.  Why only 4 stars... you gotta be hooked up to wifi.  *eh*  You're not always able to wifi when you've got down time... I have it on a samsung tablet and on a kindle.  It doesn't freeze or crash or at least not so far - I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",
"drags and crashes fairly regularly on my kindle- which bums grandson seriously.  I will keep looking. I just wish when you go to the kindle app store, the apps would work really well on any kindle.",
"It's a bit jerky and I do have to really work to get to a place I need to get to... so maybe not super intuitive for older folks?  Everyday I work with it though in order to get the most out of my Alexa.  If you order Alexa you will have to use this app.  *note: I am using the app on my android device... it might work more easily with one of my kindles, however, it's still a bit more difficult to navigate than I would like.  I am certain they will improve it.",
"Yeah.  If you like the movie, you're gonna love this slots game.  I have found it's a little tight.. but the graphics and story makes it a great time waster.  Also, you do NOT have to have internet connection to play.  It doesn't freeze or shut down.  So far, I like it.",
"It's a great way to search an area for sale or rent...  You can set the notifications which is useful.  If you looking to buy or rent, I recommend it.",
"UPDATE 3/17/2018 AVOID ALL ZYNGA games. If they decide to &#34;end&#34; a game - all the purchases you make in game are gone... not to mention any and all tokens.  What a HUGE ripoff.  BOYCOTT ZYNGA.  Unless you don't care about money.  Soooo disappointed.<br />UPDATE....9/8/2016...  I have REPEATEDLY attempted to contact the developer to inform them that you cannot click on and review ads for the 3 million tokens.  It freezes and/or shuts down every device I have it loaded on....  a kindle fire....an LG 4 smart phone.....  It is SUPER frustrating because I have sent all the asked for info.  And yet... nothing gets fixed.  Honestly, it's not worth the hassle... it WAS a sort of fun time waster... Now it's just a waste of time.  Shame on the developer.  And if you've bought ad time on this game... guess what? NO ONE is seeing it.  Grrrrrr  Worse???  This is AN AMAZON APP!!!  Amazon?? WHERE ARE YOU???",
"SUPER SUPER tight.... Buying tokens didn't help.  REQUIRES you to allow it access to your facebook if you want to &#34;register&#34;.... otherwise you play as an anonymous guest EVEN if you buy tokens.  Frankly, I would pass unless you like selling your facebook ad space and selling out all your friends and family.",
"Up side.... 1.not a lot of ads... except to buy tokens<br />Down side....<br />1. SUPER tight payouts... (cause they want you to buy tokens, right?) but that makes you less likely to play<br />2.  Once a day &#34;gift&#34; tokens... VERY small - most of the time used in 2 spins<br />3.  They bring in new games and then take them away... so far, the really fun games!<br />4.  A bunch of &#34;high roller&#34; games that are ridiculous to play unless you buy millions of tokens, so they are a waste<br />5.  Even after &#34;buying&#34; tokens they STILL don't pay out any better and STILL accost you with ads to buy more tokens.<br />6.  The worst part is that in order to make an &#34;account&#34; so you don't loose you purchased tokens you MUST allow them access to your facebook!!! You would think if you'd purchased tokens you could set up using an email.. I got the msg after trying to set up with my gmail, &#34;We are currently not allowing account setups with gmail.&#34;  - or any other email.<br />So I guess when I run out of the tokens I bought I will just uninstall.<br />BEWARE of &#34;unhelpful&#34; votes as they are likely the seller that doesn't like that you are providing honest reviews.",
"lots of ads.... but it hasn't crashed my kindle hd yet... so I will keep it.  The ads actually interrupt your game which is REALLY annoying, in fact almost a deal breaker for me.  I don't &#34;purchase&#34; in game so the ads come along with the deal. It never really lets you get &#34;ahead&#34;... perhaps if you &#34;buy&#34; the tokens it might let you win more?  I am on the fence.  If I run out of tokens, I will just uninstall.  I will say that some of the slots available are sort of interesting... others are incredibly boring.  Something for everyone I guess.",
"I like Amazon music with prime much better than Pandora... it's FREE (with Prime).  Now... if it were as easy to use as Pandora and others, it would 5 star.  I love that it doesn't limit the skip forwards... you can still rate the songs... and there are SO many choices.  Just ANOTHER reason to get prime, every year.",
"This is a pretty easy game... but I like it.  I also put it with my grandson's game list on my cell as he really enjoys this type of puzzle/think games.  I have a LG G4 and so far, no issues.  I will update if there are any problems.",
"I have to admit that I was one of those who jumped ship WAY back when they decided to raise the prices SO much.  I had the get the DVD in the mail type account.  After a fair amount of time and improvements in service, I've returned for the streaming.  I do really love the access on the Fire Stick.  AND I hear that Netflix will begin being available at Marriotts.  That is perfect for me as I travel a LOT I stay exclusively at Marriotts for the points.  Win..win.",
"I have a kindle HD... so far it hasn't crashed... but the sound is a bit wanky on some of the sounds... I would give it an additional star for better quality sound and less obvious looping - making the sounds longer so you can't figure the pattern... Some of the sounds are just awful... what they call &#34;air conditioning&#34; sounds like blasting jet engines to me.  But if that is &#34;white noise&#34; for you, you'll love it.  The cat purring is pretty cool - if you have a cat or miss your cat... Wish the &#34;chimes&#34; was not so sharp --- a deeper tone. There are &#34;adjustments&#34; but they aren't quite enough to make the sounds comfortable.  You could possibly wake the dead with the sharp tones of the &#34;chimes&#34; -plus the loop on this one is way too short.... Anyway... I pretty sure there's something for everyone.  It's all personal preference. I dislike that just leaving the app doesn't turn it off.  You have to actually chose &#34;exit&#34; on a drop down list.  Anyway... For the sounds and use as &#34;white&#34; noise&#34;....I recommend giving it a try and decide for yourself.",
"Nope.  Not only did it NOT work... it messed up my fire remote causing Amazon to send a replacement.  What a drag.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S5.  Too bad they encourage you in the Fire Stick tutorial to &#34;pair&#34; your android/iphone to your stick.  What a big mess.  Not a fan.<br />*However... after remote was replaced, the Fire Stick works well.. just remember you must be connected to really strong, reliable internet for streaming or face the constant &#34;slow internet&#34; popup.....",
"Honestly, this is probably a game meant for the 8-10 year range... so I am a BIT beyond their &#34;target&#34; age.  That being said... I like the mind numbing quality and the distraction of it.  You &#34;accept&#34; rescue animals, feed, treat, care for them and then they are adopted or released.  It's time management, although there is no penalty and task juggling. You can accumulate pretend $$ that allow you to &#34;purchase&#34; other items, yard decor, etc... I don't notice any annoying app habits (ads, contstant reminder pop-ups - etc).  I think it does drain a bit of your battery... but I usually don't play it that long.  I also have a task killer to be sure it's off when I'm done as with all apps.  Honestly, it's good, easy fun.  I hope they will itroduce new animals as time goes on and new care options.  I got this as a free app of the day, however, it would be worth a buck or two to me otherwise. Happy brain break to all!",
got this game for those moments when I have to sit for a minute or two... it's fun... maybe alittle complicated but still fun.  I actually got this for my 4 year old grandson to work on with me.  We like to laugh together and this definitely works in that world.,
Ahhhh... there is only one tune and once you do it successfully I guess you just keep doing the same thing to beat your last time?? It would be cool if there were a dozen different tunes... different levels... increasing the challenge?  I think it could be a lot more fun... it's just not to me....I just uninstalled it.,
"This is great if you have a few minutes to waste, this is a great game.... you tap the matching icons... I was confused for just a second trying to slide the icons to match them. I have this loaded on my kindle fire HDX and my samsung galaxy 5. No problems so far.",
The puzzles are Xmas themed as you would expect. There is a small ad bar on bottom of screen that isn't annoying. The games are very easy but it does offer a hint before you 'hang'. I think this would be fun for 8-10yrs. Probably too easy for adults but if you are looking for a holiday time blower this is a good one. You can register and track highest scores. Nice that you aren't asked to buy more stuff as you're playing.,
"Overall, I pretty much am not in love with Facebook, but if you want to keep in touch with the youngsters in your family, you've got to do facebook... which means getting the app too.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 and it seems to work. But I do prefer to access Facebook from my computer.  Easier to see all the options.",
Sadly this game crashed my phone every single time I tried to use it.... Samsung Galaxy5...,
"I travel Alaska multiple times a year.  App works and is useful.  I haven't had any issues with it.  NOTE: if you purchase a &#34;vacation package&#34; on the website, the app will not help you with your seats or other changes.. you will have to call the &#34;vacation specialists&#34; for that still. Will move to 5 stars once they can add that.",
"My husband convinced me to try this app as we are traveling more on United than in the past... it's very easy to use.  You can change seats, do some upgrades and basically see what's going on with your flight.  So much quicker than a phone call. So far, no negative effects on my phone, ie... crashes, etc...  I like it.",
"Honestly, this is pretty good for free.  The ads are too annoying and it's a brainless time waster.  I have a galaxy 5 and it works well.",
"I have a samsung galaxy 5... and it crashed my phone about three times so I removed it.  Also, the ads were so annoying.",
"This game is pretty light weight, but it is amusing.  While I tried I actually bought it for my 3 1/2 grandson thinking he will like it... explore it... The good news is that there isn't any annoying ads, popups, or bloat ware that I am aware of or have noticed. I actually really like playing it.  The old guy's voice is so sweet with his accent and encouraging comments.  It's sort of a puzzle/solution type of game. He tells you what he wants you to do and then you figure out, with the seemingly random pieces, how to accomplish the task. I got it as a FAOTD.  Hope you can catch it if comes back around, however, I think I might actually pay for it.  Hope this helps in some way.",
"It may be free to download and play for a few rounds... but then the &#34;opportunity&#34; to pay to advance is presented.  I just HATE that.  And thus, I quickly uninstalled.  Before discovering the paid &#34;opportunites&#34; I found it just &#34;ok&#34; and quickly boring.",
"I downloaded this game and played several rounds before deciding it just wasn't fun.  As others reported, the size of the screen is problematic.  In fact, I didn't realize the first game I had to slide the scene back and forth as there were areas I wasn't seeing and was &#34;missing&#34; items.  Just wasn't as good as I had hoped for.  If you like it, good!  This is just my personal opinion!",
I thought this would be a little more full anatomy... it's mostly muscular.  Which is great if that is your study.  It is a personal choice and this app is just not for me.,
"I got this app to help me relax and practice meditation.  It is a personal choice, but I found this app helpful.  I also believe that this type of relaxation and meditation is good for mind and body.",
My grandson loves this game.  I have a several on my phone for whenever the time arises.  He loves trains and puzzles so this works brilliantly.,
I have a variety of games for my 3 year old grandson to play on my phone and he likes this one.  I prefer games that have something to offer educationally and this one is great.  Challenging but still fun.,
"Listen, most word games are about all the same... and this one is too.  But it is fun, makes your brain think.  But it's not too hard.  Just enough to make you think and yet, not too hard so that it isn't fun.",
"I use Open table mostly when I am traveling.  It is helpful when trying to locate a restaurant nearby AND see the menu before getting there.  Open Table offers the phone number and map directions.  I have collected a bunch of diner &#34;points&#34;... not sure what I will do with them... but supposedly you'll get free meals and such.  Haven't done that yet, so I can't speak to that.  I do think it's very handy to use just about everywhere.",
"My 3 year old grandson starts with this one, before moving on to puzzles and such... He LOVES it.  I thought he would get tired of it but so far, not.  I find myself doodling with it from time to time.  It does appear to carry spy or bloatware so that is a bonus too.",
I got this as a free app of the day. Its a good time spender. Has never crashed and as far as I can tell no malware. It did annoy me by the rating pop up between games so hopefully this will solve that. I play it and so does my 3 year grandson. He likes to cut the buttons and then &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; to start over. Its great free but I probably would have considered buying it.,
"I got this for my 2 yr old grandson. He LOVES it. Bonus, it didn't suck my battery. I was worried some of the games would be too hard but no. I would easily recommend this one.",
a necessary read,
It's really amazing. Reminds me not to drink too much water at once.,
But unfortunately you can’t play it on newer versions of computers.  We love it so much with our son thought we would try it with our grandson.,
"DVD 's arrive on time and in good condition. Reasonable, low pricing for subscription.",
"As a legal immigrant, I feel they are anti American, I love America and love Trump.",
"I love this app on my Fire 10 pad, I set it on my tread mill, and walk very fast with it. Exercise is boring without it. This is fun.<br />Lost 7 pound without trying.",
"I assume it is great, but Twitter tells me my phone number is used by some one else, I gave them my house phone. HELLO, stupid Twitter tells me they mailed me password, really on a land line phone? Smart Twitter acting stupid. I have my telephone number forever on my Amazon account and smart phone. I do not know how I can get on Twitter. Maybe someone can give me advice for my smart phone, I sure not smart enough to tell Twitter or know how to contact them.",
"Useless, wants me to put in the name, how do I know the name from callers, who call you all day. Only telephone numbers do not work alone for blocking.",
"I keep the Amazon Fire Phone in my pocket all day. The End of the day, I see if I met my goal, I average 6000-10,000 per day. which keeps me fit. Great App. Shows how far I went, calories  etc.",
"I have FB for 5 years, and really got into it, I enjoy my page: I LOVE AMERICA.  Have almost 11,000 FB people, we enjoy the same conservative views and it keeps me busy. It is actually a job. (joking) Recommend it highly. Thank you FB, who every invented it.",
"Being from Europe and like German, Italian and French music. This is the greatest music station ever. You can build your own radio, 1000's of German albums and from over every country in the world.  If you classical fantastic. I also love 60's music form America. You will love this station. I promise it. 7 days are free, or you can pay 3.99 this is word it. It is a great company.",
Recommend it highly for my Amazon Fire Phone and it is free.,
I hate this app so much so not but it.,
Good apps. But have code for digital and some don’t work very fussy and movies are too expensive,

"I’m playing on ps5 and it’s interesting.  It’s unique, massive, and has a neat story.  People are freaking out angry about this game.  I don’t think it’s a top 10 game but it’s definitely a good game on ps5 (played at launch).",
Nostalgic fun.  A bit slow.  I hope they don’t stretch it out too far.  It’s good tho,
This was an order for my kids & they have really enjoyed playing this PC game.,
"These work great, They use batteries which is a bummer, but for the 40 less that i paid its worth it. Batteries last a long time. Have been using to play rocket league on the switch with no issues",
"I would recommend to anyone looking to add just a little bit of height and a lot of grip to their thumb sticks. These will not create miracles, but it will give you better leverage for shooters.",

Instant delivery!,
"you should probably get these. you'll journal about the next-level experience, or at least sit there and revel for a couple min. honestly, it's like you've never heard footsteps before. or windows systems settings. they recommend against using 7.1 surround sound on microsoft teams and skype -- but nobody said SMACK about zoom. these professors be twich streamin asmr evry time they take a drink of their 'make me talky' water. sometimes it blocks out my boyfriends nonsense caveman grumblins while hes playing rocket league and im on the sims, or i guess you can turn up the ambience and pretend you cant hear someone unironically ironically screaming POGGERS every 3 min. great deal on prime day btw. now, razer, or amazon, whoever comes first, just keep the discounts for the next year please so I can sell my last kidney to afford the rest of my pc build. thanks. cheers xx<br /><br />ps. half-joking about the selling my organs thing and poggers thing. kind of. hook it up for ur fav broke AF college graphic designer, would you pleaseee. :) &lt;3",
"*it fits TWO wired Retro-bit 6 button controllers. Yes, the ones with the 8 ft cables.<br />Plus, a cut-out area for the console, and the factory hdmi and power supply fit it the lid pouch.<br /><br />warning: the stock 3 button controllers won't fit<br /><br />great simple case with good stamp-cut foam padding",
"Sony and Amazon are collaborating in an Auto-renew scam<br /><br />Buying this turns on Auto-renew allowing Sony to charge double the annual fee<br /><br />Sony is exploiting the financially challenged, Amazon gets kickbacks, and people who deserved to be burned alive are unscathed.",
"good, a tad bit too bulky, but good. they stay on. good texture too.",
just another cheap knock-off. It does not fasten itself to the bottom of the console at all!,
"I really like how consistent the bright was is throughout. The size is perfect. My only complaint is the thread they used to hold the light bar around the outside of the pad is very rough. Because of the side my forearm sits on it, and it gets irritated sometimes in long gaming sessions. I have found if I put a washcloth, or other mousepad over it if I am planning to be playing a while its better. But this covers the lighting and is not really as aesthetically. pleasing. So 4 stars.",
I ordered these in black and white and they both came with different strap options. I have 2 quest 2's and it's nice having the different colors for each one. They work really well. The straps have a lot of adjustment options and they don't seem to block the sensors at all. I ended up removing the stock wrist strap so it doesn't flop around when using the controllers.,
"I might pay $5 for this, but for what they are asking.... No way.<br />The velcro is a cheap solution and doesn't hold it tight. The clip is not tight enough and actually jabs the back of my head.<br />Not recommended.",
"This is pretty comfortable and seems to do the job well. The band adjusts easily and seems to hold the headset in place well, even during Beat Saber or Fit XR.<br />Not sure about the Longevity and it's a bit expensive considering you don't get any additional foam for it and there doesn't seem to be any options to replace. Hoping the seller stands behind their product in the event the foam doesn't last long.",
The straps are very functional. I do wish they were at a bit of an angle for shooting games. I feel like I have to loosen the straps and it makes them less functional. Works great for Synth Ryder's and Beat Saber though.,
"See pics, I have a Vive DAS and rubber insulators on the controllers. It does hold everything, and it does seem a bit more organized than just sitting it on the desk...<br />But I'm not sure if it really does much for opening up any space that wasn't already available.<br />I had to use alien tape on the bottom so I could have the edge of the mount off the desk, to make it really worth it.<br />Also the piece that the headset rests on is too close to the controller stands for the Quest. I had to put a zip tie under it to hold it a bit higher to allow the controllers to fit properly.",
"The portion of the mount that attaches to the DAS is just tight enough to damaged the VIVE DAS but not tight enough to hold it into place when just a bit of force is applied. At first I thought it was supposed to come off until it did it 3-4 more times, each time a bit easier and now the fitting on the DAS that locks it into place is damaged and no longer will hold onto even my VIVE! Thanks for nothing! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS!~<br />They need to redesign this.",
"NOT RECCOMENDED, BROKE 2MONTYS AFTER I PURCHASED IT",
"Great set at a fantastic price. My son's old stylus broke and he has been using these for a while, they are very durable and the colors are nice",
"So, I got this and used this game for the first time when I was with my son. He has a WII and his girlfriend (who has two little girls ages 5 and 9) came over with her children when we started playing it. OMG, I have never seen children have so much fun. They squealed with delight when I put on 'What does the Fox say?' and I must have listened to that particular song half a dozen times when I was using it (lol, obviously their favorite song). Anyway, hours and hours of fun for the family. Complete with songs for all ages of users (I liked the Motown stuff, Ain't no mountain high enough and Walk this way), we all got into it. The competition between us users was fun, I don't think I have laughed this much in ages. And, as far as exercise goes, what a great concept for a game! I have used it twice since I returned from my son's and I can see where this will be part of my regular exercise routine. Fun, entertaining and great for the cardio. Kids love it, parents will all find something in it they love as well. Makes a great holiday gift for the entire family!",
Updating my Disney movies to Blu Ray. was happy this came out for Christmas at a price I was willing to pay. Grand kids love it.  Not as good as the other Lion King movies,
"We have owned this in VHS, DVD and now blu ray.<br />My daughter wore out the VHS back in the 80s. so as they aged we got he DVD. Kids are much older but still like Disney for a good viewing.<br />it was time to upgrade to Blu Ray (Disney has us) since now our Grandson is getting of age to start watching.<br />the blu ray was better quality than the VHS and DVD. It reminded me of watching this at the theater as a kid with my parents way back when.<br /><br />we'll continue to upgrade as long as the quality continues to improve on the classics.",
I bought this as a Christmas present to my granddaughter and she LOVES it.  She started out being able to be very creative with its easy-to-follow directions and on-screen information.  It was so much fun watching her be creative.,

"I purchased a Switch to be able to play with my grandsons online possibly, I did purchase a few games I thought I might like to play on my own.  This one is monoploy, risk and trivial pursuit.  I like monopoly and trivial pursuit... not a fan of risk.  I found Monopoly a bit too complicated with super too much special effects.. overwhelming and moves a bit slow because you're always waiting (even if you chose fast options) for the game to do it's ""moves.""  Eh.  Trivial pursuit was sort of fun - it picks your fellow contestants - you chose the number of opponents.  I didn't open risk as it is not a game I like.  Overall, it's ok.  In my personal opinion - should be about 1/2 the price.  But it's a Switch game so, they are basically the same price - good or not.",
"I actually purchased this so that I could have the chance to possibly play games with grandsons via the internet... so far I haven't done that.. and I have only played the Animal pet game ... it is interesting - but honestly, it's been sitting for a couple of weeks in it's charger and I haven't played it as long.  It is fun to play in your hand or on your tv... but I will say it doesn't ""consume"" me or grab my attention.  I did set it all up on my own and I am NOT technically brilliant - 60 years old.  If I can do it, you can too.  I had thought that because of the virus I would need some thing new to be a distraction, but I'd rather ride my bike or take a walk!  Ha.  I think it is a fun distraction - but apparently not every day.",
I just purchased a switch in order to play with my grandsons who live in another state.  This set seemed like a good idea.  I really have no idea what I will like/need.  This set has a LOT of stuff.  I bet there will be something I need in it.  If for nothing else it has a holder for all the game chips you'll soon have!  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful and I will do that as I learn more about my new game system!,
"I am HUGE Pirates fan AND a Johnny Depp fan... so double bonus for me.  You have to own all 4 if you're going to watch them. Each one good in it's own way.  Clearly the first is one of the best.  However, I personally love the last of the 4 so far.  I love the mermaids.  Oooo.  Watch out guys.  In any case... I would say ok for age 8 and up... but that is a personal thought... to each their own I don't judge.",
"I still own my Wii which works perfectly and I LOVE the Just Dance game discs.  I have 5.  Honestly, I consider them exercise, but fun.  Each disc has several &#34;levels&#34; of effort and using the top songs of the year which also adds to the fun.  If you have a Wii, these are just a must have.  We use them at family gatherings too.",
"Stopped working an hour after my son started playing, started freezing and couldn't get it to work. Ended up trashing it , temper temper.",
My grandson loved it,
"Initially it was a great product! Although I believe that the PS4 does not need a cooling device I purchased it for security, as a &#34;just in case&#34;!  But, after utilizing the device on my PS4 for a number of hours the small fans suddenly begin to make an enormous amount of noise! At times the noise from the fans was louder than the music and sound effects coming from my surround sound system! I would not recommend this product, especially considering that it is not a necessity exclamation point I do not believe that the PlayStation 4 has any cooling issues!",
As expected,
As expected,
Kids love them and they work great,
I gave this to my son for his birthday...he said the controllers feel good and the buttons are good so one happy camper....no complaints from my gamer,
Bought this for playstation. Works great. Worth the money,
"I bought this for a non-gaming friend whose keyboard died. She loves it, especially that you can pick among 7 colors to suit your mood that day!",
Headset worked fairly well when new but less than 6 months later it has major connectivity issues.  It has basically stopped working. Will not purchase again.,
"This Is An Excellent Movie, Love It. I Saw It Quite A Long Time Ago, & It's Still Great.",
"Bought this for my boys to use and they love it. I’ve also used it and compared to a lot of others, the grip and handles are very comfortable. Good price and I got the insurance it offers for only $3. Can’t beat that.",
My son loves it it’s durable and has lots of room for games.,
Works great!,
My 2 grandchildren absolutely loved this gift.,
My son loves it! Glad we got it for him for Christmas. Would buy it for him again. Seems eaxy to use.,
Good quality,
"Boyfriend loves these, they protect his controllers from getting scuffed up",
Works great. Fast shipping.,
working great...no glitches..yeah!!,
"it would only download one game...there were supposed to be 5 games on the disc, but only the first game would download.",
WASTE OF TIME NOT ENOUGH LEVELS AND NOT EXPLANATION OF WHAT WINS THE STARS,
Horrible game. Need to be able to play without worrying about online control.,
works good,
Won’t loose the games  put it in box to safe !!,
I love it as used often,
It okay not much use for playing  but we use wii mostly of time ....,
My grandniece play once a while and like it so much,
My grand niece and i are enjoying with games ...,
It alright once awhile to play ...,
Authentic XBOX one controller.  Works perfectly! Cheaper than gamestop.,
"The single best thing about this controller is that it has the ability to wake up the switch. At this price point, that is not a given. However, this controller feels extremely cheap. It is much lighter than a premium controller, and has slippery plastic handles with no grips. Basically, it feels very cheap when you hold it.<br /><br />I've only had it for a week, but I am subtracting another star for drift. On one occasion, it was pulling left for no reason, and I had to restart the controller to fix the issue.<br /><br />Lastly, it's nice that there is a turbo feature, but it is not very intuitive. It doesn't provide enough feedback as you set up turbo, so it's hard to know where you are in the process.",
"it’s Thanos so we shouldn’t give him any stars because...well...it’s Thanos!<br />But as long as we keep him in the box, humanity just may survive.",
makes it alot eaiser to play games on laptop,
Nice little gift for Grandson,
Good game,
Fun game shipping and handling charges prices are good.,
Theses are goods.,
Is good. Like long time.,
"First it shorted one of my controllers, and then the charge port for the battery corroded and is completely useless now. All of my electronics are taken care of exactly as suggested by manufacturers. I always read 100% of manuals and care instructions",
"This must be a joke. The PSVR converter box doesn't even closely fit in this product that says "" Specially Designed for the PSVR. I truly cant believe that the company would even sell this. Very disappointed.",
"I was disappointed with this game. The strategy is very simple, limiting interaction and leaning heavily towards button-mashing.<br /><br />Obviously marketed towards a younger audience, it is little more than a rail shooter with isometric melee action sprinkled throughout. I was hoping for free-flight game play, especially with some kind of overworld map, delivered in an RPG-like fashion.<br /><br />I realize it was one of the first few 3DS titles, but it could be a lot better. The trailers and pre-release info were also misleading, indicating a far more exciting experience than what is actually provided.",
"This is a classic RTS (real time strategy) game set in space.<br /><br />It is to this day one of the best 3D space games there are. The 3D system is neither overwhelming nor simplistic. It allows realistic 3D movement, full control of an entire space armada, yet comes across as sleek and inviting, with a gentle and intuitive UI and fantastic graphics for its time. The strategy, especially in the single player campaign, can get a bit stale or seem oversimplified (swarms of enemy fighters seem impossible to kill, some missions are ridiculously difficult no matter how huge of an armada you throw at them), but overall it is worth playing. Multiplayer skirmish mode is highly recommended.<br /><br />This is a great choice for LAN parties.",
"I do indeed like this product, but I admit that when I ordered it, I was expecting the same exact feel of a real SNES controller. Either that's something that's difficult to replicate, or they designed this product for longer life, but it feels a little tougher and slightly less responsive than a real one. The buttons are a little harder to press and the whole thing looks a little more sturdy, but again I would much prefer one built like the original. It gets the job done though.",
"I returned it, I didn't realize a ""skin"" was a cover for the mouse, I thought it was a mouse with the print on it. It was cute, just wasnt clear on the product and there was no photo showing a sticker....",
"Arrived fast, priced fair, and works perfectly. I've been using this for a couple of months now with no issues.",
Sturdy plastic and vibrant colors make this a nice addition to our Wii U,
"Works perfectly. I've had this for a while now, and use it daily for about an hour. No issues at all. The extra long cord is a huge plus.",
Item arrived quickly and was exactly what my family wanted. The way this game was designed to have the plot flow with the decisions you make based on your own personality is genius. Unlike most other games where once you have beat the game the fun is over. With this game you feel like you want to play again and make different choices to see the outcome.,
I got this for my granddaughters quest and she says it works if fits but it's just too heavy After a while,
Always nice to have an extra battery handy and this 1 actually fits,
This is handy to have because everyone needs an extra battery when gaming,
This is just too bulky to wear And very Uncomfortable,
I got this for my granddaughters virtual reality game peace. She said it was okay when she 1st put it on but after wearing it a while it became very Uncomfortable So she had to take it off.,
"This is an ok headset. It is not scratchy sounding. The headset is a bit tight on a normal size head, maybe better for a teen. The sound quality is not bad for the price but it could be better. Volume control works good as does the mic. Padding on the headset keeps out about 85% of the noise. It is all size adjustable...",
"I picked this book up at a library used book sale. I read the blurb that it had a ghost in it and that's what I like. I have never read anything by him and also didn't know at the time that it was for a young adult. With all that being said, I must say I really enjoyed it. it was a well written mystery,but towards the end it had some confusing areas and the ending could have been different. all in all I was glad I got it and read it.",
was not for me but my grson said it worked fine since it was a used one..good sale and fast shipper,
"My son loves it.. committed himself to playing the online version to level 20 and begged until I bought the actual game. Kind of disappointed with the monthly payments.. didn't know about that but overall I'm happy with the purchase, shipping and the deal.",
"Frogwares' seventh installment of Sherlock Holmes is absolutely stunning. With incredibly lifelike modeling and rendering (you can practically count the pores on characters faces), a wide range of immersive environments with real-time effects (blowing leaves, running water, etc.), and plenty of intrigue to keep both Holmes and Watson busy, the game most certainly is afoot.<br /><br />Crimes and Punishments is not a linear story; rather, it is made up of six separate games loosely connected by the appearance of the Merry Men, a gang of terrorists. Several of the stories are taken from canon (Black Peter, Abbey Grange).<br /><br />As you play through the first case, on-screen guidance explains the gameplay basics. As Sherlock, you have several tools at your disposal, including a research library of encyclopedias and newspapers, a laboratory where you will be required to perform different types of chemical analyses, and Toby, the best nose in the British empire. You also have a full wardrobe of potential disguises including a makeup table; this will be of importance at several points in the game. At certain points, you have the chance to switch between Sherlock and Watson, a constable, and Toby, the “best nose in the British Empire.”<br /><br />There are several new features here from previous installments of Frogwares’ series, including Sherlock's mind palace, where you visually connect glowing synapses as new clues are unearthed, leading you to a series of possible conclusions as to the culprit(s). Depending on the conclusions you reach, various suspects will be pronounced guilty. Sherlock then has the additional responsibility of deciding whether to arrest or absolve each killer. Another feature is Sherlock's in-depth analysis of characters; you have the ability to slowly pan over each suspect, and Sherlock points out various facts that will enable you to unlock key plot points based on these observations. Sherlock also has two additional tools in his arsenal; one allowed you to observe details that others would miss (this is accomplished through a filter than also distorts background sounds), and the other allows you to mentally recreate an object (this is a mini puzzle in itself as each “mental object” requires manipulation to function).<br /><br />The locations range from grimy London alleys to Roman ruins, elaborate Chinese temples, and stately manors. Each felt totally unique and distinct from the others; in fact I was floored by the attention to detail and number of explorable areas as other detective games I have played give a much smaller venue.  In addition to puzzles (which range from frequently easy to very difficult), there are a series of mini-games that involve boxing, archery, chemical analysis, recreating objects, and a whole lot of lockpicking. These mini games can be skipped, which will drastically shorten the length of the game. It’s also obvious that the mini games were designed with console gaming in mind, as accomplishing some of them on a computer keyboard (without a joypad) is pretty much impossible, but I was able to accomplish most of them successfully.<br /><br />I found the length of the cases to be a bit uneven; for example, the first, second, and fourth cases felt shorter in comparison to the other three. I also felt the second case was the weakest of the six as the locations all felt extremely repetitive and I had deduced the basic plot very early into my investigation. The disguise feature is a great idea, but it seems to only have an effect at a couple of points in the game; it would have been interesting to see how suspects and NPCs reacted to Sherlock depending on his outfit at a given time. I would have also liked to see greater weight placed on the morality system; you are notified if you made the correct deduction, then told what percentage of fellow Steam gamers made the same judgment call. Once you make a final decision, the game erases all save points for that case, so if you want to see various endings, be sure to do so BEFORE accepting the final decision.<br /><br />There are also a number of awards that can be earned for accomplishing various cases, conversations, and minigames, which adds to the replay value.<br /><br />Voice acting was generally excellent, with dialogue that felt true to the characters and the period. The banter between Sherlock and Watson (and Sherlock's jibes at Lestrade and his brother Mycroft) felt true to the original stories. Even Mrs. Hudson makes an appearance, as do the Baker Street Irregulars and Bill Wiggins, who play a key role in several of the cases.<br /><br />Fans of BBC Sherlock, the original Conan Doyle stories, and detective novels in general (especially if you are a fan of the older Agatha Christie PC games as I am) will find much to recommend Sherlock; the graphics are simply stunning, the environments are totally immersive, and the replay value is high as there are so many potential outcomes, optional clues, minigames, and awards to earn. This is truly one of the best and most impressive PC games I have played in the last decade.",
"I had a free version of McAfee provided through AT&T that I had been using for many years until I was offered the chance to try the Total Protection version; so far, my computer has been infected with several adware / malware outbreaks that McAfee did not catch (instead, I had to resort to downloading and running Malwarebytes and SpyBot). Even while infected, the full McAfee scans came up &#34;clean&#34; each time. I had no issues with the PC install on Windows 8.1, but the &#34;free&#34; mobile McAfee app I started getting e-mails about did not work and I uninstalled it.<br /><br />Compared to other &#34;premium&#34; packages I've used in the past (including Endpoint), the interface is very, very basic and does not seem to allow for advanced options. I also wish this had a built-in Facebook wall scanner like Norton offers as FB is becoming a common place to download infected files through shared links, etc.<br /><br />And the fact that several Potentially Unwanted Programs / malware were not detected despite running the most recent version of detection files did not boost my confidence either; I think I'll stick with the free version provided by my Internet provider.",
"I've played nearly all of the 28 Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive; my favorites of all time were [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]](due to the great creepy voodoo vibe and goth prince Harry), [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] and [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]]. I loved the combination of culture, history, and mystery in these games.<br /><br />In Ghost of Thornton Hall, Nancy is called upon to find Jessalyn Thornton, a missing bride-to-be on Blackrock Island, ancestral home of the Thornton family. Thornton Hall is a dilapidated antebellum mansion flanked by skeletal moss-draped trees and a crypt / graveyard. Like CRY, you'll spend the entire game at night, which means lots of dark lighting (and ambiance). As other reviewers have pointed out, GTH felt a bit like a mashup of [[ASIN:B003BHGWMY Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and Legend of the Crystal Skull (missing bride-to-be + lots of time spent in graveyards / crypts).<br /><br />You'll spend much of the game untangling two separate mysteries: piecing together the puzzle of the missing bride-to-be as well as the death of Charlotte Thornton, whose ghost is said to haunt Blackrock Island. Nancy has the chance to interrogate several members of the Thornton family, although I would have liked to see more actual snooping (there's definitely much less snooping than in earlier games...and where do these people sleep / eat since no one apparently has a room at the house?).<br /><br />You're limited to three main locations; I would have liked a couple of extra rooms to explore within Thornton Hall (one humorous random ND moment: there's a tea set where you can make yourself unlimited tea, and then I realized that this was one of the few games without a bathroom!). A few more hotspots would have been nice, too (Jessalyn's purse is on the floor, but you can't explore it. Wait, shouldn't there be some evidence in there??). However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.<br /><br />SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it. Creepy events happen in every room at any moment, and combined with the eerie music (which has a great vocal / cello soundtrack), keep you on the edge of your seat. For me, the biggest cop-out was the supposed explanation for these at the end of the game...which wouldn't have explained all the sightings anyway. The game was morbid more than scary; there are several surprisingly dark subplots and possible endings for an ND game, and several of the conversations involve some pretty black humor on the part of one character in particular.<br /><br />The puzzles offered sufficient variety, but I would have liked to see more use made of the ghost hunting equipment that Savannah Woodham left for Nancy; it's pretty obvious that the hauntings are off the charts, but you only use it for one puzzle and then you're done (SAW was great about using EVP recorders and the like to try and capture evidence).<br /><br />If you're stuck, you can use the hint feature if you're playing as an Amateur Sleuth. Another cool touch is that there are three possible endings depending on how you play out the final scenario. It was fun playing through all three to see the different endings, which also added replay value. One feature that I liked was that you can instantly see which awards you've earned throughout the course of the game using the new trophy menu display; each time you earn a new award, you'll get a notification (there are A LOT of possible awards this time around, adding to the replay value). And there's FINALLY a feature that lets you fast-forward through conversations, which is especially handy if you're replaying the game.<br /><br />The game's atmosphere, music, graphics and story were great; it's definitely one of the best games from the last couple of years post-SAW, but it still seemed short compared to earlier games like Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge. However, if you're a fan of ""spooky"" ND games like Mystery in a Haunted Mansion, Legend of the Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge, you'll love Ghost of Thornton Hall!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plot<br />Graphics<br />Music<br />Creepy atmosphere<br />New features (fast-forward through conversations, new trophy menu)<br />Replay value<br /><br />Cons:<br />Seemed short<br />Could have benefitted from a few extra rooms / locations to explore<br />You spend a lot of time backtracking, especially later in the game<br />Contains some pretty heavy / dark topics for younger players",
"To sum up this game in one word: tedious. That's unfortunate, since there was so much that could have been done with the setting and theme.<br /><br />**First impressions...**<br /><br />The first thing you notice is that the traditional ""Nancy's desk"" intro is gone. So, too, is any sort of exposition; I felt as if I'd just been dropped into the desert with no backstory or idea of what was going on. As you have conversations with the suspects and phone friends, you start to put the pieces together, but that came fairly late in the game for me.<br /><br />Most notably, there are very few settings and few hotspots to interact with. There are really only two main locations, the campsite and the tomb. You can pan around the camp, but despite several close-up shots, there's rarely anything to click on. Some background animations (palm branches waving in the desert wind, perhaps some glowing embers from the campfire, scuttling scarabs) would have done wonders to bring the dig site to life. Inside the main tent, it feels like wasted space. You can't pan, and there's nothing to explore inside the bunks. Even items that seemed like they should be explorable (like a purse left out in the open) aren't clickable. You see shelves in the tent; my first thought was, ""aha, supplies!"" but once again, there's no hotspots. There are several snooping puzzles that require you to go through personal belongings, and as mentioned above, there's hardly anything clickable despite lots of potential ""hotspots"" (a digital camera that I was sure would have incriminating evidence, a voice recorder like the one from SAW, but I couldn't click on either).<br /><br />**Puzzles**<br /><br />The puzzles are tedious; it felt like all I kept doing was finding and translating hieroglyphs. On the Amateur Sleuth level, you can skip all the hieroglyph translation by clicking on the ""quick translate"" button. Even some of the puzzles shamelessly repeat themselves during the course of the game. You're given several archeological tools appropriate for a dig site; it's a shame that the game didn't require you to make more use of them.<br /><br />I kept getting lost in the tunnels. True, you're given a map, but it lacks a ""you are here"" feature, and the tunnels look very similar in some cases. More importantly, there was no sense of foreboding, no sense that Nancy really is being stalked by an otherworldly curse. Nancy debunks the ""curse"" events almost immediately after they happen, which takes away any sense of suspense that would have otherwise been generated. I felt no sense of urgency, no hair standing up on the back of my neck, nothing that seemed creepy/spooky like the yurei in [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]] (watery footprints, ghostly reflections, etc.).<br /><br />The character rendering and animation was generally good, but some of the mannerisms (Dylan's constantly putting his arm behind his head, Abdullah's accent) were grating and repetitive. Two of the character accents were particularly grating; Abdullah sounded like a close cousin of Antonio Banderas channeling Puss in Boots, and Jamila sounded like she just stepped out of a British boarding school (both are supposed to be Egyptian).<br /><br />**Chatting up the suspects**<br /><br />It didn't seem like there were many conversation branches to pursue, and some of the follow-up questions didn't make sense (a character would spend two or three minutes giving an answer, and the next question was ""why are you here?"").<br /><br />Some of the scripted conversations seemed a bit questionable. One involved a crack about the British Empire, and the other involved a scenario that sounded a lot like the Book of Revelation and the Rapture, if you subscribe to that sort of thing. This surprised me, as ND games are generally neutral towards political and religious themes.<br /><br />Character-wise, there seems to be more depth and backstory than in many ND games, and the ending is brilliant; you're never quite sure who the villain is until the very end (shades of Agatha Christie here).<br /><br />**Setting**<br /><br />I feel let down that modern-day Egypt was completely overlooked. Unlike [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] or [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]], where you had traditional foods, games, etc. from Italy and Japan, there's nothing to tie TMB to modern Egypt, only the ancient past. You only deal with hieroglyphs and no modern Arabic. A little of both would have worked wonders. It would have been awesome for Nancy to visit a traditional Cairo souk (market), ride a camel to see the pyramids and Sphynx at Giza (even a cutscene would have sufficed) or have to travel between the dig site and a museum to interview / look for clues. Instead, you're confined to one location with few people to talk to, mostly phone friends, which grew old quickly, but the remoteness of the dig site is a central part of the plot.<br /><br />The problem with TMB is that the temples and Egyptian artifacts lack any kind of context or historical explanation. I would have preferred to see TMB be more like [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]], where Nancy was an intern in a museum. There, the educational games felt natural and I learned a lot at the same time. Another good example of the ancient Egyptian genre is [[ASIN:B0017AJMX8 Dracula Origin]]; it had one part that was set in modern Egypt; there you got to hunt for artifacts in the museum, translate hieroglyphs, and it was actually fun.<br /><br />**The new interface**<br /><br />I thought the new interface worked well and made it easy to access important information. The Hints Hotline was in use almost constantly, since I was frequently stuck (it progressively gives you hints until you have the option to see the full solution; this is done in red font, so you can avoid seeing the complete solution if you choose).<br /><br />Also, I  had some issues with the scrolling text boxes during conversations. The letters on the left-hand side kept getting chopped off, so you'd have to guess at the first letter or two of words. Not a major issue, but a bit annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />There are also phone charms to collect, but these seemed totally out of place in Ancient Egypt. In SAW, when you're in Japan, cell phone charms are all the rage and it makes sense to see them in the game, but it seemed out of place in an Egyptian tomb.<br /><br />**Final verdict:**<br /><br />Since I've always been interested in Egypt, there is some replay value; the graphics are simply gorgeous, and you'll see plenty of familiar names and faces from Ancient Egyptian culture, but if you're looking for edge-of-your seat drama like SAW, sadly Nancy won't find it in Egypt. The plot kind of grew on me as the game progressed, but more explorable areas, particularly above-ground, would have gone a long way to making TMB feel less claustrophobic.<br /><br />The teaser for ND27 looks promising!<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Beautiful graphics<br />+ Music<br />+ Ancient Egyptian culture<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Accents<br />- Lack of hotspots / animation<br />- Lack of areas to explore<br />- Repetitive puzzles",
"Shadow at the Water's Edge (SAW) is Nancy Drew's 23rd mystery with Her Interactive, and it's one of the most impressive in terms of story, puzzles, and spooky ambience. Nancy is taking a well-deserved vacation at the Ryokan Hiei, a traditional inn in Kyoto, Japan. From the moment Nancy arrives, there are spooky omens, and the Shimizu family isn't very talkative about the family tragedy that hangs over the ryokan. Part of Nancy's job is to teach English through the Japan Teacher Exchange program, so you'll have various homework assignments to grade in the evenings. Because you're teaching all day, the game takes place at night, adding to the creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />Shadow at the Water's Edge is one of the scariest games next to Curse of Blackmoor Manor (note that the game is rated E (10+), so there's no gore or violence, but there are some heart-stopping moments). Various paranormal phenomena follow Nancy as she attempts to discover the secrets hiding inside the ryokan, and these were genuinely scary, since several were still unexplained after the finale. This is also one of the longest Nancy Drew games, with ample opportunity for sleuthing, snooping, and interviewing. You'll have the opportunity to hop on the subway as well as conduct phone interviews in your quest for the truth behind the hauntings.<br /><br />The game designers did a good job on incorporating Japanese culture into the game. You'll find Harajuku-inspired fashion, traditional Japanese gardens, cute cell phone charms, and customizable cell phone avatars that you can assign to your cell contacts (design enough, and you can win an award at the end of the game). I loved the little authentic touches, like the very Japanese hot water heater perched over Yumi's apartment sink. Nancy also has a Japanese-English dictionary to help her translate written items. The in-game music ranges from soothing, traditional Japanese instrumentals to ominous taiko drumming and sudden, eerie starts and stops that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />Gameplay is nonlinear. You can advance the game by setting your cell phone alarm; some actions can only be accomplished at certain times. There are numerous logic puzzles based on Japanese favorites like sudoku, renograms, and nonograms, along with several Japanese cultural lessons offered. If you're not a fan of sudoku and math puzzles, consider yourself warned, as you'll spend most of the game solving a variety of them. This is also one of the more difficult Nancy Drew games; I played the game on the Junior level, and ended up resorting to a walkthrough. Because of the two difficulty levels (Junior and Senior Detective), length of the game and the many opportunities for exploration (including at least three Easter eggs), the replay value is high.<br /><br />The team at Her Interactive obviously listened to fan feedback; gone are the endless list of chores and filler puzzles (you have the option to complete additional puzzles, but aren't required to do so). Nancy actually gets to snoop around...at night. There's a definite sense of danger; you can die, but there's a handy second chance feature. All of the suspects have something to hide; you'll find your opinion constantly changing based on what you unearth in your explorations. The finale (there are two possible endings based on how you react) was satisfying, as was the trailer for the next game in the series. This is the perfect game to play on Halloween and a fine return to form for Her Interactive.",
"""Warnings at Waverly Academy"" (WAC) is Nancy Drew's 21st adventure with HerInteractive. In WAC, Nancy goes undercover at Waverly Academy, a posh girls-only boarding school in New York. Some of the girls have been getting threatening notes from ""the Black Cat,"" which are then followed by malicious accidents. Nancy, as Becca Sawyer, has been asked by the school's headmistress to investigate.<br /><br />Unlike the previous installments [[ASIN:B001ANDJJU Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and [[ASIN:B0026EV5FW Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Ships]], there are five characters (suspects) that you have to befriend: Izzy Romero, Mel Corbalis, Leela Yadav, Corine Myers, and Rachel Hubbard. True, the girls fall into somewhat predictable stereotypes (the jock, the Queen Bee, the Goth girl), but they've been given distinct personalities with backstories.<br /><br />The first comparison that springs to mind is the benchmark of Nancy Drew games, [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]]. The game is not nearly as long (or difficult!) as Blackmoor Manor. Other than the fact that both games take place in drafty Gothic buildings, there's really not much in common.<br /><br />The school grounds are compact and make for easy (if limited) exploration. Inside the school, you have access to about ten or so rooms during the course of the game, along with limited space outside. I would have liked to see more areas to explore, particularly outside (there's an inviting-looking gazebo I kept wanting to explore). The puzzles fit well into the storyline. There's some filler in the form of ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" puzzles; if Nancy wants access to a particular item, she has to do something for another girl first. But these puzzles fit well and are subject-related (a science puzzle, a math problem or two). You're also responsible for working in the school's snack shop (you have to do it at least once a (game) day or you get demerits).  You can die (there's a handy Second Chance feature) or get expelled (say, for pulling the fire alarm, too many noise violations, picking locks, or sneaking out at night), but it's smooth sailing for the most part.<br /><br />Even though Nancy has had plenty of techno-tools in her arsenal in previous games, WAC felt totally current: you keep in touch with the other girls via Twitter, there's mention of MySpace (called URSpace), and part of your job is to help with the school's website. HerInteractive even did a cool ""Watching Waverly"" Twitter soap opera before the game's launch (the Twitter script can be read at  twitter dot com/HerInteractive/watchingwaverly And the school has a ""website"" at warningsatwaverlyacademy dot com (the campus map got my hopes up that it would be explorable).<br /><br />Overall, WAC was short, but fun. You really get a feel for the girls, the school, and the mystery. The historical storyline tied in well with the overall theme. The graphics look great, particularly the character animations (special mention to the modeling of Rachel; I thought I was watching a movie during cutscenes, she was so realistic). The music was perfect without being intrusive. There's a fun Easter Egg that you can find (there's probably more), and references to earlier ND games (including the ever-present Koko Kringles). And there's not much in the way of scare factor, so this is a good choice for younger gamers (much less of an emphasis on the supernatural than Blackmoor or [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]]).",
"In Nancy's eighteenth adventure from HerInteractive, Nancy makes good use of her passport in her second international outing, this time to Venice, Italy during Carnevale. Her old friend Prudence Rutherford (first heard from in [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]]) has enlists her to discover the identity of the Phantom, a masked robber who's been making off with priceless antiques. The mysterious Phantom escapes detection, having knowledge of the security systems for each site.<br /><br />Nancy's home base is Prudence's old palazzo, the Ca' Nascosta, now in a sad state of disrepair after Prudence sold it to a penny-pinching, ladder-climbing socialite. Nancy shares a room with Helena Berg, a young German journalist who is in love with Venice and hopes to move there. A British art restorer, Colin Baxter, develops a huge crush on Nancy while working on the Ca' and tries in vain to win her affection.<br /><br />Italian culture is everywhere, and Nancy must even learn some basic Italian in order to participate in an important stakeout. You carry an Italian dictionary, which comes in useful for translating signs and documents. The background audio includes several conversations in Italian, but if you don't speak Italian, these aren't crucial to the game. Many times, characters are simply commenting on the Phantom and his adventures, or about personal events. Also included are several flavors of Italian gelato, the Italian card game Scopa, the various Carnevale masks, and Venetian architecture.<br /><br />Nancy is working with the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's version of the FBI, to track the Phantom. Because it's Carnevale season, there aren't enough officers to tail him, so Nancy is given a PDA with tracking capabilities. There are several possible suspects, including Antonio Fango, the shady IT dealer who works across from Nancy's temporary residence, Enrico Tazza , a member of the Machiano Crime Syndicate and a fence for stolen goods , Colin, who has past secrets to hide, and the mysterious (and ungracious) hostess La Contessa Margherita Fauberg. Nancy has three modes of transportation: on foot (free), via vaporetto (water taxi, free), or by singing gondolier (between five and fifteen euros per trip). The main map is clearly laid out and is easy to navigate.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B0009X6QJM Nancy Drew: Secret Of the Old Clock]], Nancy must earn money in order to purchase items needed in her investigation, including books and costume accessories. You begin the game with 200 Euros, and if you budget very wisely, you won't need extra money (those fashionable shopping trips, gelato cones and singing gondoliers really add up!). If you find yourself running short, there are several ways to earn extra income, including dancing in a nightclub dressed as a slinky black cat (!).I loved the variety of the nightclub dancing, although the character animation was jerky and I would have liked to see Nancy move more than just rotating her wrist in-between moves. From my own experience, you can earn between two to over thirty euros per dance depending on how well you nail the cues (for the hearing-impaired: the dance cues are auditory, but flashing colored lights also tell you which colored button to press).<br /><br />I played the game on the Senior Detective level, which offers fewer step-by-step hints (there's no to-do list, for one) and more difficult puzzles, and the majority of the puzzles were sufficiently intuitive, but still challenging. The graphics are gorgeous as always; in scenes of the canals, visible from your bedroom balcony, the water ripples in real time. If you choose to ride a gondola (the amount varies depending on the gondolier), you're treated to a combination of still photos of Venice and rendered scenery which proves quite effective (along with the various Italian-language serenades taken from Italian opera and popular songs). Unlike some prior greats such as [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]] and [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]], the actual story in ""Phantom of Venice"" is spread a bit thin; the game could have benefitted from one or two additional suspects. But the variety of puzzles, some of which are new to the series (stakeouts, tracking, jewel heists), and the inclusion of Italian culture make up for these shortcomings.",
"Microids Dracula 3: Path of the Dragon is the sequel to its two earlier games [[ASIN:B0017HIH78 Microids: Dracula 1 & 2 DJC]]. The protagonist is Father Arno Moriani, a priest sent by the Vatican to investigate a local Transylvanian doctor who is slated for sainthood. But his seemingly simple investigation into the good doctor takes several unpredictable twists, and he soon finds himself plunged headfirst into a world of shadowy vampires, a battle that threatens not only his faith but also his life.<br /><br />The main failing of the game is the *absence* of vampires; you only deal directly with the title character at the very end of a long and tiring journey. The rest of the time, you're researching obscure texts, closely examining artwork, and leafing through hefty tomes of Romanian history that deal with the origins of Dracula, or Vlad Tepes. There are also undercurrents of WWII even though the game is set in 1920 (yep, evil Nazis and bad German accents!). There are only a handful of characters, but the ones you do interact with are generally fleshed out, with unique personalities and solid voicework.<br /><br />The puzzles themselves are some of the better ones I've seen in the last few years; there's a wide variety of strategy board games, locks, word puzzles, and inventory-based puzzles. Phlebotomy takes up a large part of the game; if you're squeamish, you probably won't go for the graphic how-to on drawing your own blood several times (""now all that's left is to push the needle deep into the vein!""), or poring over cells under a microscope.  Generally, the solutions are quite obvious, although one of the end puzzles requires careful observation and piecing together clues collected throughout the game. One of the features which could have been better utilized was the Bible passages; whenever your character is stressed out (you'll hear his heart beating loudly), you can flip open the Bible to an underlined passage that is directly related to the situation at hand. This action isn't necessary, however, and could have been made a more central element directly related to protecting Father Arno's faith (and sanity).<br /><br />The graphics are lushly drawn, bringing to life the war-torn village with its bombed-out  buildings. Ghostly howls ricochet down the empty streets. The lushness of Budapest is a direct contrast to war-ravaged Romania, and you visit rural Turkey as well. Character animations are effective, and the cutscenes are downright gorgeous, with a hazy, dreamlike quality (you're able to replay videos through the gallery feature on the main menu). The only disappointment was the ending; after so many hours of research and daring escapes, the final confrontation was brief and disappointing. The end cinematics were great, though, and leave openings for future installments.  Overall, this is a solidly crafted adventure with loads of atmosphere and political intrigue, but sadly, little of the title character.",
